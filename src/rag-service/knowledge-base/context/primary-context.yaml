      examples:

      special_handling:
        note: "While predicates receive same semantic search weight as other context, they serve a unique regulatory purpose"
        distinction: "Initiation/Ongoing define YOUR device; Predicates define REFERENCE devices for comparison"
        usage: "Referenced when establishing equivalence, justifying design choices, or reducing testing requirements"

    notes:
      - "All three subfolders (Initiation, Ongoing, Predicates) participate equally in semantic search"
      - "Primary Context.docx is ALWAYS included at highest priority before semantic retrieval"
      - "Metadata tags preserve folder origin for traceability"
      - "Predicates are conceptually distinct (regulatory comparison devices) but technically equal in retrieval"
