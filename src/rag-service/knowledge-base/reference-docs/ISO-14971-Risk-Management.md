# ISO 14971:2019 - Medical Device Risk Management

## Overview
ISO 14971 is the international standard for risk management of medical devices.

## Key Requirements

### Risk Management Process
1. **Risk Analysis**
   - Intended use identification
   - Hazard identification
   - Risk estimation (severity × probability)

2. **Risk Evaluation**
   - Compare estimated risks against acceptability criteria
   - Determine if risk reduction needed

3. **Risk Control**
   - Implement risk control measures
   - Verify implementation
   - Assess residual risk

4. **Risk/Benefit Analysis**
   - Evaluate if medical benefit outweighs residual risk

5. **Risk Management Review**
   - Review all risk management activities
   - Ensure completeness

### Risk Management File
Must contain:
- Risk management plan
- Hazard identification records
- Risk analysis and evaluation
- Risk control measures
- Verification of risk controls
- Residual risk evaluation
- Risk/benefit analysis
- Risk management report

### Risk Acceptability Criteria
Must be defined and documented:
- Severity levels
- Probability levels
- Acceptability matrix/thresholds

### Residual Risk
After risk controls:
- Evaluate residual risk
- Document in labeling if necessary
- Ensure overall residual risk is acceptable

## Link to Design Controls (21 CFR 820)
- Risk controls become design inputs
- Risk control verification = design verification
- Risk management review at design reviews

## Common Issues
- Incomplete hazard identification
- Missing risk control verification
- Inadequate residual risk evaluation
- Poor traceability to design controls
