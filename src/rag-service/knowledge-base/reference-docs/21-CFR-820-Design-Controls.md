# 21 CFR Part 820.30 - Design Controls

## Overview
Design controls are requirements under Quality System Regulation (QSR) for medical device design and development.

## §820.30(a) - Design and Development Planning
Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures for:
- Design and development activities
- Assignment of qualified personnel
- Identification of interfaces between different groups
- Review and update of design plans as design evolves

## §820.30(b) - Design Input
Procedures to ensure design input requirements are:
- Documented
- Reviewed and approved
- Address intended use, user needs, performance requirements
- Measurable/testable
- Include regulatory requirements

## §820.30(c) - Design Output
Procedures to ensure design outputs:
- Meet design input requirements
- Contain acceptance criteria
- Ensure device is safe for intended use
- Include packaging and labeling specifications
- Are reviewed and approved before release

## §820.30(d) - Design Review
Formal documented reviews of design results must:
- Be conducted at appropriate stages
- Include representatives from all affected functions
- Document participants, date, results

## §820.30(e) - Design Verification
Procedures for design verification must:
- Confirm design output meets design input
- Include test protocols
- Document verification results
- Be performed on initial design and any changes

## §820.30(f) - Design Validation
Procedures for design validation must:
- Ensure device conforms to user needs and intended use
- Include testing under actual/simulated use conditions
- Include production units, lots, or batches
- Be performed before commercial distribution

## §820.30(g) - Design Transfer
Procedures must ensure design is correctly translated into production specifications

## §820.30(h) - Design Changes
Procedures for identification, documentation, validation/verification, review, and approval of design changes

## §820.30(i) - Design History File (DHF)
Manufacturer shall establish and maintain DHF containing or referencing documentation to demonstrate design was developed per design control procedures

## Traceability Requirements
FDA expects traceability:
- User Needs → Design Inputs
- Design Inputs → Design Outputs
- Design Outputs → Verification
- User Needs → Validation

## Common FDA 483 Observations
- Incomplete DHF
- Missing design input documentation
- Inadequate verification/validation
- Poor traceability
- Missing design review documentation
