To the Reader
Welcome to the Covidien Neurovascular Product Development Process Guide Version 3.0 (PDP3).  
This process guide is designed to assist you in understanding the neurovascular (NV) development process.  Our goals are to encourage innovation, to make development more predictable, and to allow the product development team to focus their time on actual design and development rather than deciphering the product development process.  
Using a well-defined, flexible process that fits the needs of projects of varying complexity will allow NV to better control time, cost, and development risk, and to more rapidly launch new products and product enhancements.
Another benefit of PDP3 is that it enables systematic and continual process improvement.  We ask that you follow the enclosed guidelines, but that you also question them and help us identify opportunities for further optimization and improvement.

PDP Objectives
PDP3 was designed using Lean Principles to provide a foundation for the rapid development of breakthrough and/or enhanced neurovascular products with high customer satisfaction.
With PDP3, NV project teams can “Innovate & GO!”  The considerations for this system design are discussed below:

	•	Innovate – 
Early activities of the PDP are designed to foster innovation, with a focus on developing multiple concepts and converging those concepts with the help of our customers.  PDP3 features –
	•	Voice of the Customer –
	•	A focus on clearly understanding the user needs and trade-offs early in the project. 
	•	Identification of Critical to Quality (CTQ) requirements to focus creative energy on what matters most for the customer. 
	•	Concurrent Engineering – 
	•	A full cross-functional core team is engaged from the initial phase to quickly develop concepts and run them through rapid concept evaluation cycles.
	•	Flexible Environment – 
	•	Limited documentation burden – use of drafts and streamlined approvals. 
	•	Project teams are allowed to explore multiple concepts and technologies without prematurely committing to a final launch date. 

	•	GO! – 
As the team reaches design freeze, the PDP is designed for rapid, predictable delivery to the customer.  Though innovation is still important throughout the development effort, the project team focuses on execution of the pre-established plans to validate the design and processes and meet business objectives.  PDP3 features – 
	•	Lean Considerations – 
	•	Concurrent engineering – The advanced Phase Gate system design encourages execution of activities from future phases in parallel instead of in strict series.
	•	Streamlined RACI – the process for team members to approve project deliverables throughout the development cycle has been optimized to enhance speed without jeopardizing quality.
	•	Short feedback loops – The use of concurrent engineering and the placement of the reviews are designed to prevent late stage product discovery (e.g., finding out that a component cannot be manufactured per the design).
	•	Tailoring – In order to make sure that all types of projects (from breakthrough to design change) can GO!, a tailoring system has been developed.  The tailoring system design is focused on making sure that the activities and deliverables add value and do not create bureaucratic waste.
	•	Localized Empowerment – Integrated project management and core team structures allow for faster team decision making and agility.
	•	Manufacturing Transfer –
	•	PDP3 adds additional clarity to the mechanics of manufacturing transfer to ensure that the process and supply chain will quickly meet or exceed the business need.
	•	The Launch Phase was added to ensure that customer and business needs are met and the launch is supported.
	•	Launch Execution –
	•	Earlier and more detailed Launch Plans will help ready the organization for launch success without delays.
	•	Physician Preference Testing ensures that there is strong customer acceptance and that the commercial launch will exceed expectations.
	•	
PDP Phases
The PDP is organized into five (5) phases of development as illustrated in Figure 1 below.  The pages in the guidebook are designated by a matching color bar in the right margin to facilitate document usability.  These phase names are shared throughout Covidien. 

Figure 1 – Phases of the Product Development Process (PDP)

These phases can be summarized as follows – 
Phase 1 – Concept 
	•	The product concept advances from the problem domain (user needs) to the solution domain (technical specifications).
	•	Major unknowns (technical or market) are examined to reduce the project and product risks.
	•	A number of alternative conceptual prototypes are developed and evaluated for relevance to user needs and for technical feasibility.
	•	Ends in concept selection.
Phase 2 – Feasibility
	•	The product design is optimized to ensure that it is safe, manufacturable, cost effective and reliable.
	•	Supply chain activities are initiated to ensure that the desired supplier quality, capacity, cost, and capability are achieved.
	•	The process is designed to meet the technical specifications.
	•	Ends in design freeze.
Phase 3 – Development
	•	Design verification and design validation are performed.
	•	The manufacturing process is finalized to ensure that target quantities, yields, and cost can be realized.
	•	Ends in primary design verification and validation completion.
Phase 4 – Qualification 
	•	The manufacturing process is validated.
	•	Physician Preference Testing (PPT) as well as clinical trials are conducted (if required).
	•	The manufacturing transfer and launch strategies are developed and agreed upon.
	•	Ends in market launch.
Phase 5 – Launch
	•	Lessons learned are captured.
	•	Customer feedback is captured, including requests for new features as well as concerns.
	•	The manufacturing process for the product is further refined to improve yield, cost, capacity, etc.
	•	Ends in disbanding project team.

The phases, key accomplishments and deliverables are captured in this guidance document.  The term “guidance” implies a process that is adaptable to the needs of a specific project.  The intent is to provide a tool that assists cross-functional Project Teams in planning, monitoring and executing projects.
Each phase of the PDP is distinguished by its deliverables.  Each deliverable of the PDP is designed to contain the correct elements, to improve communication between functional areas, and to assure that regulatory compliance is achieved.
An easy way to see how the various functional areas contribute to the development of a new product is through a “swim lane” diagram.  The PDP Swim Lane Diagram (Figure 2) highlights the deliverables that are fundamental to each Phase.  This figure also illustrates how the various functional groups collaborate to accomplish the phase objectives.  The Swim Lane diagram shown in Figure 2 below provides a high-level view of the development process with the following information –
	•	Major Deliverables – Identification of key deliverables created in each phase along with the functional area primarily accountable for the deliverable.  
	•	Information Flow – Information is developed and flows between activities as work progresses. For example, in the Concept Phase, product development starts with user needs, which are prioritized and then converted to engineering terms (technical specifications).  Multiple potential concepts are then created and evaluated against defined criteria in order to select the concept which is the best strategic fit for the customer and the business.  
	•	Concurrent Engineering – The relative position of major activities and deliverables in each phase indicates when concurrent engineering activities should be occurring to reduce project completion time and improve results.
	•	Reviews & Milestones – Timing of formal reviews and milestones act as “checkpoints” within the PDP3 process. Reviews and milestones are positioned to ensure that the design is progressing as expected and that the Business Case for the product is met.

PDP3 Integration with Project Management Methodology (PMM) 
PDP3 is designed to integrate with the Project Management Methodology (PMM) in order to produce a successful product.  PDP3 and the PMM are integrated through several key touch points including:
	•	Project Charter – The Project Charter is the agreement between the Project Sponsor / Team and executive management.  The Project Charter is described in greater detail in the Phase 1 - Concept section below.
	•	Project Plan – The Project Plan is the agreement between the Project Sponsor, the Project Manager, and the Project Team.  The Project defines how the project will be executed in accordance with PDP3.
	•	Project Team – The Project Team (Core and Extended Teams) executes the project utilizing PDP3 guidance.  Members of the Project Team will fulfill one or more of the roles specified in Table 1 and Table 2.

The PDP3 RACI
The PDP3 RACI serves the following purposes:
	•	Provides a project planning tool throughout all phases of PDP projects.
	•	Defines the scope of a project in terms of tailoring all PDP Deliverables either “Required” or “Tailored Out” of the work scope of the project.
	•	Provides a formal approval process for defining the level of tailoring used by the project and the resource assignments.
	•	Defines accountability for the completion and accuracy of each PDP phase deliverable.
The matrix includes all of the defined phase deliverables (within this guidance document), including reference procedures/guidance documents/templates, and a corresponding matrix listing which function is Responsible/Reviewer, Accountable/Owner, Consulted/Contributor, and the Informed for the completion of each deliverable.  These resources and deliverables are assessed by Senior Staff at the Concept Phase exit.  
Table 3 – RACI Role Definitions



The process for completing the Tailoring Plan is provided in the PDP Tailoring section of this guidebook.
	•	All PDP functional groups should be involved in the development and detailed review of the Tailoring Plan.
	•	Utilization of the Tailoring Plan is a requirement for all PDP projects.

NOTE – Reference the PDP Tailoring section of this guidebook for more information on tailoring deliverables and activities required in PDP3 for specific needs of a project.


Figure 3 – Example of Completed Tailoring Plan (screen shot)



PDP Reviews 
Reviews are a critical part of a well-defined product development process.  The reviews defined in this PDP guidebook are used to improve the quality of technical documentation, to ensure that deliverables are complete, and to provide product and project updates.  
PDP3 contains two types of reviews – 
Technical – Review of work products related to the product design (e.g., test results, specification conformance matrix, etc.).
Phase Reviews - Review of work products related to business, planning, and process compliance (e.g., IP Strategy, Clinical Development Plan, Clinical Readiness, Regulatory Strategy, etc.).  These reviews must include an overview of the technical reviews and outputs held for a product. 
Each type of review can be further defined as follows:
Technical Reviews
	•	A technical review is a formal, comprehensive, systematic and methodical review of a design by a team whose expertise encompasses all technical aspects of the design and must include an independent reviewer(s).
	•	These reviews are highly cross-functional and focus on the ability to meet both customer and operations requirements.
	•	These reviews provide confirmation that pertinent technical data was discussed, feedback was received and that the project may proceed with the remainder of the phase or with a Phase Gate review.
Interim (Including Non-Scheduled) Phase Reviews
	•	A Non-Scheduled Phase Review is held when a project will move outside the bounds of its Project Charter, and does not fall in line with a scheduled Phase Review, Clinical Readiness Review or other scheduled non-technical review.
	•	These reviews focus on resolving specific issues that significantly impact the project and are not a complete review of all aspects of the project.
	•	The Core Team involves extended team members and functional management in developing and reviewing recommendations and alternatives.
	•	May propose changes to the project scope, resources or timing.
	•	Impact of the proposed alternatives need to be clearly understood.
	•	Impact of not resolving the issue must be presented.
	•	Once a decision is made, the Senior Staff must approve the revised Project Charter. 
	•	Reestablish project deliverables, resources and timing.
	•	Set new bounds for functional and cross-functional reviews.
	•	The Senior Staff can recommend canceling the project if the issues are severe.
	•	Cancellation can also come as a recommendation from the team.
	•	
	•	Clinical Readiness Review:
	•	Also when it is the intention of a project to begin human use during the middle of a Phase, a Clinical Readiness Review is held with the same requirements as a standard Phase review.  This review goes through all of the deliverables required to be completed in order to begin first human use.  A typical Phase IV review must still be held following completion of all Phase IV activities.
Phase Reviews (Non-Technical)
	•	Phase Reviews are the mechanism by which the Senior Staff reviews, approves and directs projects at the end of each phase.  Senior Staff reviews the output of the team for completeness against the project plan and design control requirements.
	•	These reviews are event-driven and are conducted from a business perspective; they are not the same and do not replace technical reviews.
	•	The purpose of Phase Reviews is to assess fulfillment of the phase objectives and enable the Senior Staff to make well-informed project decisions early in the development cycle to improve time-to-market.
	•	Reviews progress against the Project Plan and reviews project risks.
	•	The outcome of each Phase Review is as follows.
	•	An decision to continue (GO), cancel (NO-GO), or redirect the project.
	•	In the special case of a redirect, the Senior Staff and Core Team agree to a clear list of issues to be addressed and a specific date when the Core Team will come back to the Senior Staff for a GO/NO-GO decision.
	•	In rare cases a CONDITIONAL GO may be authorized, which requires a discrete one or few deliverables to be completed prior to closing the phase, but does not require re-review of the Phase by Senior Staff.  In most cases, this should not be the team recommendation going into a Phase Review, because the team is held accountable for completeness.
	•	Approval decisions require an allocation of capital and human resources to successfully complete the next phase.

PDP3 Relationship to Quality System Documentation	
PDP3 provides guidance for development process activities which are governed under QAP 4.1 Design Controls.  Figure 4 defines how PDP3 and its accompanying documents fit into the hierarchy of the Quality System.   Additionally, for ease of use, PDP3 has been designed to work with several accompanying documents, as defined in Figure 4 below.

Figure 4 – PDP3 Document Hierarchy 

As the figure shows, the following elements contribute to a complete and comprehensive product development process.
Quality Assurance Procedure QAP 4.1 – Defines the official Covidien Neurovascular design control requirements.  Compliance to QAP4.1 is mandatory per Covidien Neurovascular’s Quality System.  QAP4.1 covers a subset of the guidance materials.
PDP3 – Provides guidance on best practices for product development.
Tailoring / RACI Matrix (“PDP3 RACI”) – Microsoft Excel® document provides guidance on the content of each deliverable and required approvals.  
Auxiliary Processes – Provide additional in-depth guidance related to a specific process area within the product development process.
PDP3 Templates – Provide additional guidance on the content of specific deliverables by establishing standards and examples that allow best practices to be leveraged over multiple development efforts.

Getting Started – Project Initiation 
Product Development Process (PDP) projects are initiated by the NV Portfolio Management Team as part of the portfolio management business process.
Early-stage R&D or marketing exploratory activities prior to PDP initiation are sometimes referred to as “Phase 0” activities.  To more formally explore new technologies, a companion business process called the “Technology Development Process (TDP)” may be employed, by which entrance into the PDP would occur at a prescribed exit review within the TDP.  The TDP process is not covered within this Guidebook.  
Entry criteria to begin Phase 1: 
	•	Business model loaded into Enrich Software – All divisions of Covidien Vascular Therapies are required to load project financial information to calculate financial metrics, such as 10-year NPV.  This information is used by the NV Portfolio Management Team to choose and prioritize projects.
	•	The Portfolio Management Team approves the project
	•	A Project Sponsor is selected – The Portfolio Management team selects a sponsor for the project.  For new product development, this is often the Technical Director.
	•	The Project Sponsor selects a Project Manager.
	•	The Project Manager works with the Functional Managers to select a Core Team.  The team then begins working on the Project Charter (Phase 1 deliverable).
	•	Project Initiation Form (CF1658) is completed and approved.  This form is attached to the Project Plan in the Concept Phase.

Phase 1 – Concept Phase  
Overview 
The Concept Phase starts the formal Product Development Process (PDP).  In this phase, the main goal is to evaluate the business potential and technical feasibility of one or more product concepts so that the business can make a decision whether to commit the budget, resources, and time to develop the product.  

Key Accomplishments
Gather and prioritize user needs.
Evaluate various candidate concepts and select the concept that is the best strategic fit for the business need.
Perform competitive analysis and survey the intellectual property landscape.
Identify and mitigate technology and product safety risks.
Perform detailed planning of the Feasibility Phase and high level planning of all subsequent phases for the product.
Make a Go/No-Go decision, once a viable concept is identified.

Concept Phase Description
Process Step
Detailed Instructions
	•	Entry into Concept Phase
The following criteria must be met to enter into the phase –
Business model is loaded into Enrich Software.
Project Sponsor, Project Manager, and Core Team are identified.  
Management has provided budget and resources to accomplish the activities of the Phase.
Project Initiation form (CF1658) is completed.  This form is ultimately attached to the Project Plan.
	•	
	•	Create the Project Charter
The initial activity performed in the Concept Phase is the creation of the Project Charter, which includes definition of key parameters of the product, estimated time and resources required to accomplish the scope, and the key elements of the business case that show the product is a good fit into the overall investment portfolio.  Additional guidance for the Project Charter is located in DPRD01.  
A project team recommendation to combine PDP Phases must be justified and approved in the Project Plan [see additional details in the Tailoring Section of this Guidebook].
The Project Charter should be maintained and updated as necessary over the life of the product development effort.
The identification of significant changes to the Charter signals the need for an Interim Phase Review of the proposed changes, resulting in either approval or rejection of a modified Charter and all its downstream consequences.

	•	Create the Project Plan
Another initial activity performed in the Concept Phase is the creation of the Project Plan, which includes objectives, scope, schedule, budget, and resources required for the project.  Project planning is conducted per QAP4.11 with additional guidance below.  

Key steps in project planning include –
Align on project objectives.
Complete the Tailoring Plan to determine what PDP deliverables are in-scope for the project (for details see the chapter on PDP Tailoring).  The Tailoring Plan is attached to the Project History File (PHF).   
Identify all other work products for the project. Some work products are not directly identified in the Tailoring Plan, but may be important for the project. 
Conduct a Kickoff Planning session involving the extended team and all critical customer & support functions to develop or validate the Project Plan including a detailed schedule (typ. Gantt).  
For long projects, it may be impractical to have a schedule detailed to the task level for the entire project.  At a minimum, the Project Plan should provide a high level schedule for the entire project and a detailed schedule for the upcoming phase (with the exception of Phase 1 which is planned at the beginning of the phase and often will include Phase 2 detail).
	•	
	•	The Project Plan is maintained and updated as necessary over the course of the project.  
	•	
	•	Initiate the Design History File
All projects subject to design controls require a Design History File (DHF).  The DHF is initiated in the Concept Phase and maintained throughout the product development cycle.  The DHF shall contain or reference the records necessary to demonstrate that the design was developed in accordance with the Project Plan and QAP4.1.  

Key steps in initiating and maintaining the DHF include – 
	•	The DHF should be maintained as results are made available throughout each phase.
	•	Non-mandatory “Recommended” PDP documents are not typically required to be listed in the DHF.  Refer to the PDP RACI for guidance on what documents to reference in the DHF.  These “Recommended” documents are typically referenced in other documents but may be added as deemed necessary by the project team.   
	•	If a document is a numeric controlled document, the DHF should be updated to include it.  This document may be noted in a latter phase where the deliverable is required per the DHF Checklist template.  Upon alpha release of the document, the DHF must be updated to reflect this change in the phase where the deliverable is required.
	•	The DHF must be updated at the conclusion of each phase with deliverable result references.
	•	The DHF must be audited by Quality Engineering and released at the conclusion of each phase to ensure accuracy, typically shortly after the Phase Review meeting.  
	•	Initiate the Project History File
All project documents that are not referenced directly on the DHF are listed in the Project History File (PHF).  

	•	QAP4.1 and PDP3 RACI list documents to be referenced directly on the DHF.
	•	All other documents to be listed in the PHF – 
The PHF has the deliverables listed as “required for this project” from the Tailoring Plan.
PHF deliverable references specific to the completed phase are to be listed in the Phase Review slide deck, demonstrating completion of those activities.
The PHF ultimately becomes part of the Phase Review records. 
	•	Gain a Clear  Understanding of User Needs
One of the key objectives of the Concept Phase is to gain an understanding of user needs.  This assures that when released to market, the product is successful both in the eyes of customers as well as from a business perspective.  Several Voice of the Customer (VOC) activities comprise this step.

	•	Voice of the Customer Plan (VOCP) 
	•	A VOCP is approved to detail and direct the activities required to complete this process step.  The VOCP is created early in this phase and is updated as needed throughout the product development cycle. 
	•	A Concept Selection Report is created towards the end of this phase and includes what has been learned from the Concept Phase activities carried out in accordance with the VOCP.
	•	The Marketing Claims Matrix is used to identify the claims marketing desires to make regarding a new product or new feature. It outlines the supporting data and regulatory requirements needed to support the desired claims. This tool is intended to be updated throughout the development process.  

NOTE – Additional information on Gathering the Voice of the Customer can be found in Appendix A1.

User Needs and the Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM)
The User Needs are elicited through the VOC activities.  Early in this phase, the most important user needs that the product must meet are documented in the first section of the Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM).  The SCM is updated throughout the phase as additional needs are identified and as those needs are translated into more specific user needs.
By the end of the Concept Phase a preliminary version of the SCM is reviewed.
Also by the end of this phase, Critical to Quality (CTQ) elements are selected and denoted in the draft SCM.  These elements represent the key requirements that must be met to satisfy the customer. 

NOTE – Tips for Developing Good Requirements can be found in Appendix A5.

Concept Development
Based on the User Needs, brainstorming of various product concepts is performed.  Ideas are captured in Engineering Notebooks or preliminary rough drafts to allow prototype development to occur.
Test Method Development
The Design Test Method (TM) Documents are initiated in the Concept Phase to include the test methods required to evaluate the competing concepts and competitive products.
Competitive Analysis
Analysis of competitive products is performed and documented in the Concept Selection Report. Knowledge of competitive products can be used to help set preliminary requirements and specifications.
Prototype Development
	•	Multiple device prototypes are developed to further elicit VOC, to refine understanding of user needs, and to test the suitability of potential designs to meet requirements.
Prototypes may include –
Simple drawings and artwork representing product concepts.
3D models of product concepts.
Actual devices produced as the result of design efforts with target materials and manufacturing processes.
Input from representative customers is required to identify those requirements that are Critical to Quality (CTQ).
During prototype development, the Project Team should engage the Advanced Sourcing and Supplier Quality groups for any sourcing decisions.

NOTE – Prototypes developed during the Concept Phase are always “proof of concept” and should never be considered to be the “final” design.  

	•	Conduct Preliminary Engineering Design
The creation of physical prototypes requires that R&D, Process and Quality engineers begin to translate perceived user needs into technical specifications and associated design and process documentation. The key deliverables of this effort include –

Preliminary Technical Specifications
The Technical Specifications contain requirements that are derived from sources including –
User Needs
Standards and Regulatory Requirements
Hazard Analysis
Manufacturing Standards
Technical Specifications are drafted but not fully developed at the conclusion of the Concept Phase.
Technical Specifications are listed in the Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM).
Multiple Device Prototypes
Multiple physical prototypes are developed to support –
VOC activities
Feasibility studies that compare the performance of the evolving design to the requirements
Risk and hazard mitigation
Manufacturing planning
Competing concepts are evaluated to determine the best fit for the customer and business needs.  The result of the evaluation of these concepts is documented in the Concept Selection Report.  

NOTE – Additional information on Design Convergence of Different Concepts can be found in Appendix A4.

Preliminary Design Specifications
In order to produce physical prototypes, the Design Drawings will be produced.  These typically are in the form of component, assembly, and top level drawings or solid models.
While not “final” specifications, standard engineering practice should be followed to assure that these early drawings comply with established procedures for these documents.  
Product Risk Management
Approval of the Risk Management Plan – Outlines the risk management activities to be performed throughout the phases of product development to ensure that the product has an acceptable level of risk.  Risk Management is conducted per QAP 4.19.  
Approval of the Procedure Hazard Analysis (PHA), part of the Risk Management Workbook (RMW), assures that medical risks are understood early in the design.  The PHA is developed in accordance with QAP 4.9.
Review of Manufacturing and Assembly Processes
Develop and review methods/processes used to manufacture and assemble concept models and prototypes.
Develop draft manufacturing analysis, process flow model, and cost model for each prototype model planned to exit phase.
Technical Risk Management
Technical project risk is managed via use of project management tools like the Risk Register.

NOTE – Most deliverables in this step are draft documents and would not be considered complete or near complete.  These deliverables include only the most important information required to document the major elements of the prototypes to be created.  Draft documents are approved as per Appendix C.

	•	Plan Development Builds
The project manager should establish a clear line of communication with production planning and pilot line management around the development build plan and upcoming builds.  A recurring meeting should be established to monitor changes in build requirements.  
	•	Conduct IP Planning Session
The project manager and Legal (IP) group conduct an IP Planning Session to lay out the IP milestones and deliverables.  The IP attorney signs that the session was conducted on the “IP Planning Session Record” form.  Include the signed form in the Phase 1 Review slide deck.
	•	Create the Regulatory Plan
	•	Create and approve the Regulatory Plan to outline the regulatory strategy and approach for all intended markets.
	•	Domestic Markets, European Markets, IDM, CAPLA, etc… should be discussed including submission strategies.
	•	Specific regulatory requirements for FDA, CE, PMDA, CMDA, TGA, SFDA, KFDA, etc… should be discussed in detail in order to appropriately plan the feasibility, development, and testing stages of the project.
	•	The regulatory and marketing team members should work directly with the RBU teams to integrate all international requirements in to the project via the Regulatory Plan.

	•	Draft Functional Plans
During the Concept Phase, team members begin to assess the impact of this product on their activities.  

Once one or more concepts that meet the business needs are identified, plans should be created for all support functions that will participate in product development.  Planning for the following functions can start during the Concept Phase, but will not be completed until development of the concept is well underway (ref. PDP RACI) –
Clinical Development Plan – Outlines the approach to clinical testing and potential clinical trials. – (Clinical Studies, if required to validate marketing claims or fulfill regulatory requirements, are an element that may be conducted during Design Validation.)
Supplier Development Plan – Outlines the types of suppliers and components that will require assessment and qualification, and defines how suppliers will be managed.
Design Characterization Matrix (DCM) – Outlines the activities and testing to be performed to develop the engineering design specifications and to define challenge testing to verify that those specifications are correct.
Process Characterization Plan – Outlines the activities that will be performed to assess the feasibility and availability of different process technologies, determines parameters for qualification and production, and develops and selects the appropriate assembly flow and processes to support the manufacturing and cost of the proposed product.

NOTE – Most plans are living documents and should be updated throughout the product development cycle as further knowledge is gathered.

	•	Exit from Concept Phase
The Concept Phase is exited once a Go/No-Go decision is made as a result of the Phase Gate Review (see Table 5).  The following exit criteria must be met to exit this phase -

Planning of the Feasibility Phase is completed.
High level planning of the entire project is completed.
At least one candidate concept has testing that demonstrates a good fit for both customer and business needs.
The business case for the product and project is established.
Remaining technical, project, and product risks are understood and mitigation plans are in place.

Feasibility Phase Description
Process Step
Detailed Instructions
	•	Validate the VOC to Technical Specifications Translation
VOC activities will continue and are an essential part of the Feasibility Phase.

Voice of the Customer activities in the Feasibility Phase include –

Document VOC Activities – Feasibility testing is performed in the Feasibility Phase to document VOC activities.  This testing is performed through consolidation of design options through an iterative process of design and testing.  Functional and performance data is gathered to demonstrate that the consolidated design will, with reasonable confidence of success, meet User Needs.

Baseline the User Needs – The Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM), which includes the User Needs and Technical Specifications is completed and approved.  The final inputs to the User Needs come from  – 
Competitive product analysis, within the Concept Selection Report, provides additional user needs necessary for the product to be competitive in the market.   
The VOC is validated with the customer as demos, prototypes, tests, data and drawings that become available from the design work being performed concurrently.  Customer feedback is reviewed to determine if user needs need to be added or modified.  
Translation of User Needs into Technical Specifications and designs.  As design work evolves and it becomes apparent that certain user needs cannot be met within the constraints of the project, the SCM is re-assessed.
During this process Critical to Quality (CTQ) elements of the product and its design are determined and documented in the SCM.  (Reference DPRD02.)

Baseline the Technical Specifications – The Technical Specifications (also referred to as Product Specifications) are finalized and approved in the Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM).  The Technical Specifications are system requirements to which the design must conform.  Detailed design work ensures that the requirements are achievable given the project constraints of time, budget, resources, and technology. 

NOTE – The User Needs are typically base lined prior to the Technical Specifications.  The Technical Specifications may evolve as Steps 2 and 3 below are conducted.

Conduct Technical Specifications Review –The customer and product requirements are the foundation of all subsequent design work. To ensure that this is a solid foundation, a technical review of the requirements is performed to ensure that they possess the characteristics of good requirements and that all User Needs are accounted for in the Technical Specifications.  Reference the section in Appendix 5 on Characteristics of Good Requirements.

As part of the requirements reviews, Critical to Quality (CTQ) requirements are verified to ensure that they have been properly traced from the User Needs to Technical Specifications.
	•	
	•	Complete Detailed Design
The preliminary design created during the Concept Phase is evolved to ensure that all Technical Specifications can be satisfied and that the design will meet its reliability, safety, quality, cost, and performance goals.  Depending on the complexity of the design, the product (or “system”) may be partitioned into two or more integrated subsystems.  

EXAMPLE – A system for delivering coils to an aneurysm can be decomposed into the coil, the pusher used to deliver the coils, and the detachment device.  This would require design work to be performed on each of the subsystems and design outputs to be created for each of the subsystems. The partitioning of functionality to subsystems, and the interfaces between subsystems, must be carefully specified and managed to ensure integration.

Key steps in completing the detailed design include –

Evolve the design – Iteratively optimize the design and make design decisions based on data gathered from activities performed to assess critical areas of the design.  The Design Characterization Matrix (DCM) is used to document which activities will be performed for a specific project.  Activities can include –
Competitive Analysis / Benchmarks
Design calculations
Tolerance Analysis Report
Design of Experiments
Design for manufacturability and assembly
Finite element analysis
Reliability testing
Mechanical models 
Simulations
Modeling
Design test methods
Design Challenge Testing Protocol(s)/Report(s)
Extreme condition testing
Testing to failure

Assess and improve the safety of the design – Continually assess the safety of the device by performing risk management activities as defined in the Risk Management Plan (RMP), including the contents of the Risk Management Workbook (RMW).  The PHA, UFMECA and DFMECA sections of the RMW are completed in accordance with QAP 4.9.  The RMW is approved in the Feasibility Phase with initial risk evaluation of the following –
	•	The Procedure Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a top-down assessment of hazards and clinical effects.
	•	The User Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (UFMECA) is a sequential risk assessment used to determine the risk level associated with foreseeable misuse of the product.
	•	The Design Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (DFMECA) is a bottom-up assessment of potential failures of the product and the potential effects on the end user.

Create Design Outputs – Document the design through the creation of appropriate Design Drawings (in accordance with QAP 5.20 and QAP 5.2), including –
Part and component drawings
Assembly drawings
Materials specifications
Schematics
Item Masters

Verify requirements 
Verify that all of the Technical Specifications are addressed in the design.
Critical to Quality (CTQ) requirements are verified to ensure that they have been properly traced from the Technical Specifications to the design outputs.  

NOTE – Reference Developing a Robust Design in Appendix A6 for more information on completing and optimizing the detailed design.

Initiate labeling – Label development begins in this phase with the initiation of the Labels and Information for Use (IFU).  Key requirements for this phase include –
Identification of product packaging levels (product description, GTIN, PCN/SKU, size(s), quantity of measure).
Initiation of the Product Branding Name process.
Generation of Global Trade Item Number(s) (GTIN) (in accordance with LST-003).
Generation of Product Catalog Number(s) (PCN) and item numbers (PCN + version).
Generation of RFID product classification information with RFID service provider.
Complete draft of the English version of the Instructions for Use (IFU).
Requirements identified as risk controls.
Requirements needed to conform to standards.
Requirements identifying all the languages into which the labeling and IFU must be translated.
Requirements specifying the content of all labels to appear on the packaging.
Requirements for the appearance of the packaging.
	•	
	•	Design the packaging – The packaging is designed to ensure the integrity of the device from the point of manufacture to the point of final use.  Key considerations for packaging design are –
	•	The package must keep a device sterile for the entire duration of the established shelf life throughout all the stresses and hazards generated by –
Sterilization
Shipping.
Storage environments.
	•	The packaged product may be subjected to –
Shock and vibration.
Changes in atmospheric pressure.
High and low temperature extremes.
High and low humidity extremes.

Identify Essential Design Outputs – Design outputs that are essential to the proper functioning and safety of the device are considered essential design outputs.  Those elements of the design whose failures could affect safety, effectiveness, and reliability are considered essential.  Essential design outputs are identified via –
Risk management activities.
Design reviews.
Flow down of CTQ requirements to design elements.  

NOTE – Reference Design for Safety in Appendix A6 for additional information on identifying essential characteristics of the product.

	•	Develop the Manufacturing Process
The manufacturing process that was developed during the Concept Phase is further refined, developed, and characterized to ensure that it can consistently manufacture products that meet reliability, safety, quality, cost, and performance objectives and specifications.

Key steps in development of the manufacturing process include –

Characterize the process – The Process Characterization Plan is finalized in this phase and is used to specify the activities required to assess process inputs and outputs, the range over which the process can operate without causing failures, and the capability of the process to produce the volumes required.  The process characterization activities result in -
Preliminary process inputs (material, equipment, tooling, software, manpower, methods).
Preliminary process outputs that are measurable and provide an understanding of the impact of process variables.
The development of the process parameters and process window that will be used for process qualifications, process validation, and production.
Assessment of which variables have a significant impact on the outputs and which do not.
Preliminary process flow diagrams.
Requirements for equipment, tooling, and fixtures needed.
Specification of manufacturing targets (yield, time to manufacture one unit, time resources, line layout, tact time, costs).
Requirements for process control activities.
Conduct an Impact Assessment (CFXXXX) to determine how the changes affect other product lines (process, materials, operators, etc.).
Discuss excess and obsolete inventory impact.
Requirements for capital equipment expenditures.
Environmental, health and safety issues related to the manufacture of the product.
	•	
	•	Results of the process characterization are collected throughout the Feasibility Phase and documented in the Process Characterization Report in the Development Phase.
	•	
	•	Perform Process Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) – A Process Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA), which is a section of the Risk Management Workbook (RMW), is performed, in accordance with QAP 4.18, to evaluate potential failures of the process, document the effects of the failures, and identify actions to eliminate or reduce the probability of potential failures. The PFMECA is approved in the Feasibility Phase with initial risk evaluation.  The PFMECA –
	•	Identifies potential product and process failure modes.
	•	Assesses effects of the failures on the customer and on the next downstream process.
	•	Identifies manufacturing and assembly process causes for the failure modes.
	•	Identifies process variables that can be controlled to reduce the probability of the failure mode.

Control the process – Based on process characterization activities and the Process Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) section of the Risk Management Workbook (RMW), the steps required to control the quality of the process outputs are identified.  These steps can include – 
Manufacturing Inspections – Manufacturing inspections are steps added to the process for the purpose of examining, measuring, testing, or gauging that one or more characteristics of a component, part, or assembly conforms to the specified requirements for that component, part, or assembly after one or more process steps have been completed.
Real-time Process Feedback Controls – Controls implemented in the process to manually or automatically monitor the output and adjust the process as necessary within the validated ranges to produce an acceptable product.
Statistical Process Controls (SPC) – SPC are used to monitor a production process through the use of control charts. By collecting in-process data of the output at key steps of the production process and establishing control limits, trends in the quality of the materials or processes that may affect the quality of the product can be detected before actual failures occur. 

NOTE – PDP3 emphasizes a prevention approach (as opposed to “inspecting in the quality”) while performing product development tasks throughout the development phases.  Early focus on robust product and process design will reduce the reliance on manufacturing or Quality Control (QC) inspections.  Cost of Quality (COQ) calculations demonstrate that spending additional cost and resources in early stage development on prevention measures pays large dividends in later development phases and production.  With the barrier to change increasing exponentially as the phases progress, it is imperative to challenge the design and processes early.

Define Process Validation Strategy and begin validation work – During the Feasibility Phase, the Process Master Validation Matrix (PMVM) is drafted and approved at the numeric level.  The PMVM defines broad requirements for all validation activities–
Calibration and Maintenance
Equipment Installation Qualification (IQ)
Software Validation
Test Method Validation
Equipment (or Process ) Operational Qualification (OQ)
Equipment (or Process ) Performance Qualification (PQ)
Product Performance Qualification (PPQ)
Process Revalidation 

The Process Master Validation Matrix (PMVM) is used to document and track the process validation requirements, updates to validations, subsequent validations and revalidation requirements and the output of validation activities.

In the Feasibility Phase, work is started on developing and executing appropriate equipment installation and operational and performance qualifications as the design and equipment are finalized.  

Create Device Master Records (DMR) – A draft of the Device Master Records (DMR) is created during the Feasibility Phase.  These records include, but are not limited to –
Product Drawings
Routers (Work Orders)
Bill of Materials
Packaging Specifications
Labels
Manufacturing Procedures
Packaging and Labeling Procedures
Inspection Procedures
Sterilization Procedures
Cleaning Methods and Specifications
Equipment Requirement Specifications
Equipment Drawings
Preventive Maintenance Procedures
Company Forms 
Training Requirements, Methods & Documentation
Job Safety Analyses

NOTE – Reference Developing a Robust Process in Appendix A7 for more information on developing, refining, and optimizing the manufacturing process design.

	•	Perform Supplier Development
Suppliers should be involved early in the development process to collaborate and utilize their ideas and to help ensure that the final design is compatible with their process capabilities.  

As the preliminary design of the product and the process evolves during development, identification of required components, parts, and assemblies occurs.  Once identified, the Core Team in conjunction with the Advanced Sourcing group, determines whether the required part will be made in-house or purchased (make vs. buy decision).  For all parts to be purchased, suppliers must be identified and qualified to provide the purchased parts.
 
Supplier activities performed in the Feasibility Phase include –
Finalize the Supplier Development Plan (SDP) – Execution of the SDP is initiated upon approval of the plan early in the Feasibility Phase.  However, many supplier management activities are not completed until subsequent phases.

Identify potential suppliers – One or more potential suppliers that can provide the selected parts are identified.  Suppliers are selected in accordance with QAP 6.5.  Risks related to the ability of the identified suppliers to supply the part are established based on –
Whether the part is a custom built part or an off-the-shelf part.
Complexity of its manufacture.
Criticality of the part, based on effect of failure.
Financial health of the supplier.
Ability to provide the required quantities in the required timeframes.
Overall capability of the supplier.
Availability of other suppliers to provide the same part.
Amount of capital investment required by the supplier.

NOTE – Secondary suppliers should be established based on the amount of risk identified during the initial assessment.

Add components to the Approved Supplier List (ASL) – If Covidien lot numbers are required for numeric level traceability, the Approved Supplier List (ASL) must be updated to include the applicable components as “contingent” and “pending supplier approval” in accordance with QAP 6.6 and QAP 8.4.  If supplier lot numbers will be used in place of Covidien lot numbers, components do not need to be added to the ASL (until numeric release).

Develop suppliers – Due to the nature of the technology used in Covidien products, there may be only a few potential suppliers for certain key materials and components.  
	•	Covidien may choose to work with suppliers that have the potential of delivering difficult-to-source materials and components to improve their quality system and capability so that they can become approved suppliers.  

Assess suppliers – Each potential supplier identified is assessed to determine their capability to deliver products with the desired –
Quality
Reliability
Safety
Performance 
Technological capability
Operational capability (lead times, on-time delivery, response time)

Qualify suppliers – After each candidate supplier is assessed, The Advanced Sourcing Group and Supplier Quality work to review the suppliers to ensure that they can provide the necessary quality, safety, performance, and reliability.  Additional qualifications beyond the assessments can involve –
Evaluating prototypes 
Evaluating first article(s)
Supplier audits
Capability and Gage Repeatability & Reproducibility studies
Supplier process validations

	•	Prepare for Design Verification & Validation
In order to be ready to perform formal design verification and validation in the Development Phase, many activities need to be performed in the Feasibility Phase.

The key deliverables of this effort are –
Equipment Acquisition – Equipment to be used during design verification/validation must be defined, evaluated and approved prior to use in accordance with QAP 4.17.  The acquisition process may be defined as follows and depends on the complexity of the equipment or fixture.
	•	Create the Equipment Development File (EDF) for each equipment or fixture and approve the initial requirements.
	•	Create the Equipment Requirements Specification (ERS) for the equipment.
	•	Request quotes based on the ERS and submit capital request(s).
	•	Order equipment and perform Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) at supplier’s facility to confirm equipment meets requirements per ERS.
	•	Receive equipment and perform Site Acceptance Test (SAT) to confirm equipment meets requirements per ERS upon installation at Covidien facility.  The SAT may be a subset of the FAT testing and may be combined with the IQ.
	•	Perform Installation Qualification (IQ) to verify –
Proper installation conditions (wiring, utilities, functionality, etc.).
Calibration, preventative maintenance, and cleaning schedules.
Safety features are operating correctly.
User documentation, prints, drawings, and manuals are available for the equipment.
The manufacturer has a recommended spare parts list.
Proper environmental conditions (such as temperature and humidity) for operation.
Equipment operates as per requirements.
Test Method Validation – Test methods to be used during design verification and in-process testing must themselves be validated.
The Design Test Method (TM) Documents are initiated in the Concept Phase to include the test methods required to evaluate the competing concepts and competitive products.  In the Feasibility Phase, the Test Method Documents are finalized to include test methods required for design verification testing and a plan for qualifying these methods to ensure that the data they produce are valid.
The Design Test Method Qualification Protocol(s) defines the testing to be performed to qualify test methods to be used in Design Verification and / or Design Validation.  Testing performed on each protocol is summarized in a Design Test Method Qualification Report(s).
The Design Test Method Capability and Suitability Summary ensures that qualified test methods used to perform the design verification or validation testing are suitable for the intended purposes and capable of producing valid results.

Design Verification & Validation Planning – The planning columns of the Design Master Verification & Validation Matrix (DMVM) are completed to lay out details of the design verification and validation strategy. 

	•	Design Verification / Validation Protocols – Design Verification / Validation test protocols are drafted and/or approved as required by the DMVM.    Protocols often considered in this phase are –
Biocompatibility Test Protocol
Design Verification Test (DVT) Protocol(s)
Design Validation (DVAL) Test Protocol(s) (This may include PPT and/or clinical studies, add appropriate line to DHF if these are conducted.)
Sterilization Validation Protocol
Packaging Validation Protocol
Chemical Testing (China FDA requirement)

NOTE – Biocompatibility and Sterilization Validation Protocols may be approved and execution started during the Feasibility Phase because of the long lead times typically required to complete testing.

	•	Perform Development Builds
Product builds are performed in order to confirm various aspects of the product design and other project uses.  In general, Process Development is responsible for executing and overseeing all development, validation and qualification builds (including the R&D lab, pilot line, outside vendors and/or the production floor).  This includes but is not limited to –

	•	Designed to test numeric or redlined documentation to ensure DVT build will be successful with a minimal number of non-conformances.
	•	Built using numeric or alpha release documents.


	•	Freeze the Design
Freezing the design means that the product is ready to proceed to formal design verification and validation testing.

	•	Design Freeze Technical Review - After the design has been completed and preliminary testing indicates that the design can meet the customer and product requirements, a Design Freeze Technical Review will be held in order to obtain the team’s recommendation regarding freezing the design. 
	•	Decision to Freeze - At the conclusion of the Design Freeze Technical Review, there are two possible outcomes –
	•	Decision to Proceed – If the design team believes that the design is capable of meeting the customer and product requirements, then the team will complete the remaining artifacts of the Feasibility Phase and recommend that a Phase Gate Review be scheduled.  
	•	Decision to Revise – If the team believes that there are still questionable aspects of the design, additional work will be planned and assigned to characterize and resolve the issues.  Upon successful completion of this work, the design team will either recommend to proceed or to make further revisions, and another Design Freeze Technical Review will be scheduled if necessary.

NOTE – Additional information on the Controls Before and After Design Freeze can be found in Appendix C.

	•	Complete Functional Plans
Functional plans started in the Concept Phase are updated and approved during the Feasibility Phase. In addition, the Project Plan and schedule will be updated and maintained in each phase.

Plans updated and/or approved in the Feasibility Phase include -  

Regulatory Plan
Clinical Development Plan (CDP) 
	•	If a clinical study is required per the Clinical Development Plan, a Clinical Study Protocol/Report must be included in the DHF Checklist and Tailoring Plan as a deliverable. May be waived if noted in project plan or with a memo (CF/PR) stating no CDP is necessary and approved by the same approvers.
Supplier Development Plan (SDP)

	•	Develop a Preliminary Launch Plan

	•	
	•	Prepare Covidien Innovation Metrics
In the Covidien corporate system, the end of Phase 2 is the official project team “business commit.”  Inputs from the project are loaded into the corporate Innovation Metrics software (“PDSystem”) and are reviewed to determine overall group effectiveness.   

The following information will be logged by the PMO at the conclusion of the Phase 2 review –

	•	Phase 4 planned completion date.
	•	First planned product sale date (if different than above).
	•	Worldwide revenue forecast for Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 post-launch.  Preferably this is broken down per SKU, though in some cases, this may not be feasible.  
	•	
	•	This data will be compared to actual data taken at launch and subsequent years of revenue.

	•	Multiple fixtures and equipment to handle the required capacity.
	•	Multiple-up equipment and fixturing.
	•	Poka-yoke fixturing.
	•	Operator safety.
	•	
	•	Optimize the process – To ensure Equipment/Process Validation success, the process should continue to be refined and optimized.  Results of this testing are documented in the Process Characterization Report and may include – 
	•	Additional limit testing and characterization.
	•	Bringing production tooling online to eliminate or reduce additional manufacturing and/or inspection steps.
	•	Working with the production staff to improve manufacturing and inspection procedures.
	•	Additional process capability and throughput studies.

	•	Prepare for Process Validation
The following activities are performed in the Development Phase in preparation for Equipment/Process Validation –
	•	Finalize the Process Master Validation Matrix (PMVM) – The PMVM is finalized and approved based on results of the PFMECA and process characterization results.  
	•	Perform Quality Planning for Production – During the Development Phase, activities are planned to ensure that the quality of the product to be manufactured can be evaluated and controlled.  The PMVM provides a plan for monitoring quality activities in manufacturing.  The PMVM should include –
	•	Defined sampling plans to be used.
	•	Description of processes that will require monitoring and actions to be performed based on monitoring results.
	•	Any required inspections of product in preparation for or as a results of process validation should be integrated directly in to production and performed by trained production personnel.  
	•	QC inspections should not be added unless it is absolutely necessary and the reasons why production cannot perform the inspection must be justified when implemented.  
	•	Preliminary Inspection Reduction Plan to reduce the number of inspections performed in production and to move IQC inspections From Dock to Stock where feasible. The Inspection Reduction Plan defines all QC & manufacturing inspections and conditions needed to eliminate the inspection.

Reference Process Validation in Appendix A10 for additional information regarding process validation.

	•	Validate Test Methods – Test methods used in the manufacturing process must be validated.  The Process Test Method Qualification Protocol(s) defines a series of experiments to demonstrate that the tests are adequate for the intended purposes.  Results of process test method validation(s) are documented in the Process Test Method Qualification Report(s) and applicable manufacturing or quality procedures.  Depending on the complexity of the test method being qualified, test method qualifications may be initiated in the Feasibility Phase, but completion is not required until early in the Qualification Phase.

For more information related to test method validation reference the sections on Test Method Validation and Gauge Repeatability & Reproducibility in Appendix A7. 

	•	Create Equipment/Process Validation Protocols – Equipment/Process Validation Protocols include Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ).  These protocols may be created in the Feasibility Phase and are finalized early in the Development Phase.  Equipment and process qualification are executed in accordance with QAP 4.17 and QAP 9.4.

	•	Perform Equipment/Process Qualification – Equipment/Process Qualification consists of protocols and reports related to qualifying equipment used in the manufacturing process.  Equipment qualification activities may be initiated in the Feasibility Phase, but completion is not required until the Development Phase.  These qualifications are performed in accordance with QAP 4.17.  Process qualification activities are also initiated in the Feasibility Phase, but may not be completed until early in the Qualification Phase.  These qualifications are performed in accordance with QAP 9.4.  Equipment/Process qualification consists of three types of qualification tests –


Test
Description
Installation Qualification (IQ)
	•	IQ verifies that the equipment has been installed correctly.
Operational Qualification (OQ)
	•	OQ demonstrates that the process will produce acceptable results and establishes worst case limits for process parameters.
Performance Qualification (PQ)
	•	PQ establishes long term process stability.
	•	Stand-alone qualifications that may be completed as part of equipment development and as a precursor to PPQ.

	•	Elements of the IQ include –
Proper installation conditions (wiring, utilities, functionality, etc.).
Calibration, preventative maintenance, and cleaning schedules.
Safety features are operating correctly.
User documentation, prints, drawings, and manuals are available for the equipment.
The manufacturer has a recommended spare parts list.
Proper environmental health and safety conditions (such as temperature and humidity) for operation.
Equipment operates as per requirements.
	•	
	•	Elements of the OQ include –
Process control limits (time, temperature, pressure, setup conditions, etc.).
Correct setting of software parameters.
The range of the raw material specifications (Multiple lots).
The process operating procedures.
Material handling requirements.
Process change control.
Operator training (multiple shifts, multiple operators).
Stability and capability of the process.
Possible equipment drift.
Potential failure modes, action levels, and worst-case conditions based on the PFMECA.

	•	Elements of the PQ include –
Actual product and process parameters and procedures established in OQ.
Acceptability of the product.
Assurance of process capability as established in OQ.
Process repeatability and long term process stability.
Subassembly qualification when testing cannot be performed in the final assembly form.  (For example, a laser weld may be built and tested as a subassembly to test the strength of the joint because this joint cannot be tested in the final assembly form.)
NOTE:  Individual equipment/process PQ’s may not be required if covered in the upcoming Product Performance Qualification (PPQ).  
	•	
	•	Revalidation criteria for each process are established after IQ/OQ/PQ has been performed. Revalidation of the process may be necessary if –
A change(s) is made to the process that can affect the output of the process.
A negative trend(s) in quality indicators is detected.
The product design is changed and is determined to affect the process.
The equipment is moved.
The same process is used for a different purpose.  

	•	Perform Software Validation – Software validation is performed in accordance with QAP9.7.  Any computer/PLC controlled equipment with software/firmware used in the manufacture or test of the device must demonstrate it meets its intended use.  The major focus of software validation is to verify proper performance against pre-determined criteria applicable to the intended use of the software.  Verification of proper performance can include –
Software version / configuration
Applicable user functions and operator controls
Maximum and minimum ranges for allowed operator inputs
Error and alarm conditions provided by the software
Safety related functions
Startup and power down sequences
Security requirements (identification, password)
Data retrieval and storage

	•	Initiate the Design Transfer

NOTE – PDP3 discusses design transfer from Process Development to Operations in two steps.  The first step is the transfer of the knowledge required to manufacture the device, which is called Design Transfer (initiated in this phase). The second step is the transfer of responsibility for all business-related aspects of manufacturing to Operations, which is called Manufacturing Transfer.  Manufacturing Transfer is completed in the Launch Phase and is discussed in more detail in the Manufacturing Transfer section (Appendix A13).  

Design transfer is the introduction of a design into the production environment.  Design transfer is initiated in the Development Phase to support design verification and validation builds.    

The purpose of the initiation of the first step is to ensure that –
	•	Control of all the deliverables required to manufacture the product has been initiated to prepare for transfer to Operations.

Transferring the Device Master Records (DMR) (including the BOM) to manufacturing is the major activity of design transfer. The draft Device Master Records (DMR) from the Feasibility Phase is further developed during the Development Phase by approving records at the numeric level revision (at a minimum).  These records include, but are not limited to –
Product Drawings
Routers (Work Orders)
Bill of Materials
Labeling Specifications
Packaging Specifications
Labels
Manufacturing Procedures
Packaging and Labeling Procedures
Inspection Procedures
Sterilization Procedures
Cleaning Methods and Specifications
Equipment Requirement Specifications
Equipment Drawings
Preventive Maintenance Procedures
Company Forms 
Training Requirements, Methods & Documentation

NOTE – It is NOT necessary for design transfer to occur all at once. It may occur in several steps over time.
Reference the section on Design Transfer in Appendix A9 for additional requirements for transferring the design from Process Development to Operations.

	•	Perform Design Verification Testing (DVT)
DVT activities include –

	•	Update RMW – Once design verification testing has been completed, the PHA, UFMECA and DFMECA sections of the Risk Management Workbook (RMW) are updated with residual risks and any new information learned as a result of the testing performed.  In addition, the initial risk evaluation within the PFMECA section of the RMW is updated as necessary based on any new information from the design verification testing.

	•	Ensure test coverage for all requirements – After all protocols have been executed and testing summarized, the Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM) is updated to include the following information –
	•	Trace each Technical Specification to at least one design verification/validation protocol.
	•	Trace each design verification/validation protocol to a test report that summarizes the results.
	•	
	•	Perform Design Change Assessment – The Design Change Assessment is an analysis of how design changes performed after DVT may impact the testing performed. 

Reference Verifying the Product Design in Appendix A8 for additional information on design verification.

	•	Perform Design Validation
Design validation can occur in parallel with design verification activities.  Design validation activities include –

	•	Complete Design Validation Protocols – The Design Master Verification/Validation Matrix (DMVM) will specify all Design Validation (DVAL) Test Protocol(s) that need to be executed in order to perform design validation.  

	•	NOTE – Design validation should be performed on devices which are manufactured using the same methods and procedures as production devices.  If production devices are not used, equivalency to production devices must be demonstrated.  For any differences, a justification must be provided that explains why the design validation results for the equivalent units are valid for production units.
	•	
	•	Execute Design Validation Protocols – Approved protocols are executed to provide objective evidence that design outputs meet customer needs and requirements. 

	•	Summarize testing performed – Validation testing will be summarized in the Design Validation (DVAL) Test Report(s).  

	•	Update RMW – Once design validation testing has been completed, the PHA, UFMECA and DFMECA sections of the Risk Management Workbook (RMW) are updated with residual risks and any new information learned as a result of the testing performed.  In addition, the initial risk evaluation within the PFMECA section of the RMW is updated as necessary based on any new information from the design validation testing.  

	•	Ensure appropriate test coverage for all requirements – After all protocols have been executed and testing summarized, the Specification Conformance Matrix (SCM) is updated to include the following information –
	•	Trace each User Need to at least one design validation protocol.
	•	Trace each design validation protocol to a test report that summarizes the results.

	•	Perform Design Change Assessment – The Design Change Assessment (DCA) is an analysis of how design or process changes performed after design validation may impact the requirement that validation be performed on production equivalent units. 

Reference Validating the Product Design in Appendix A8 for additional information on design validation.

	•	Complete Product Labeling Content
In order to prepare for process validation, labeling content is finalized in the Development Phase.  Labeling related activities include –

Develop labeling – Label development continues in this phase by updating the Labels and Information for Use (IFU).  Key requirements in this phase include –
Final product branding name.
Complete and approve English content of the Labels and Instructions for Use (IFU).
Artwork strategy (product, packaging, labels and IFU) as well as product packaging levels (product name and description, GTIN, PCN/SKU, size(s), quantity of measure, county of origin, manufacturing address, trademark registration and patent information).

	•	Changes to regulatory strategy.
	•	
	•	Perform Packaging Validation
	•	Validate the packaging process – the Packaging Validation Protocol may be created and approved in the Feasibility Phase due to long execution and testing lead times.  This protocol is created to define the testing required to validate both the packaging and the packaging process.
	•	The packaging is verified to ensure that it meets all relevant performance, safety, and regulatory requirements.
	•	The process used to package the device must be validated.  The process validation for packaging should include –
Packaging equipment qualification (IQ, OQ, PQ)
Final package design
Verification of expiration dates on the packages  
Extreme ranges of the process
Application and validation of any labels used as part of the process
	•	Note: Demonstration that the packaging preserved the integrity of the product device such that the device still meets its specifications after appropriate conditioning (e.g, simulated distribution testing) is typically conducted in the Design Verification above. 
	•	
	•	Summarize the results of Packaging Validation – Once testing is completed, the Packaging Validation Report is created and approved in the Development Phase to summarize the results of all testing related to packaging.

	•	Prepare for Launch
In preparation for launch, the Launch Plan is updated with current information and is approved in the Development Phase.  

	•	Perform Pre-PPQ

Qualification Phase Description
Process Step
Detailed Instructions
	•	Prepare for PPQ
Based on the Process Master Validation Matrix (PMVM), the following activities are performed in the Qualification Phase in preparation for Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) –

	•	Finalize the Equipment/Process Qualifications – Qualification of the equipment and processes used to manufacture the product is initiated in the Feasibility or Development Phase and must be finalized in the Qualification Phase prior to PPQ.  Results of equipment and process qualifications are documented in the Equipment/Process Qualification Report(s).  
	•	
	•	Finalize Pre-PPQ – Summarize the results and review as a team to determine if the process is ready for Product Performance Qualification (PPQ).  The Pre-Product Performance Qualification (pre-PPQ) Report should be completed prior to the PPQ Readiness Review (or per project plan timing; prior to the PPQ report release at the latest).  
	•	
	•	Finalize Process Test Method Validations – Validation of the process test methods is initiated in the Feasibility or Development Phase and must be finalized in the Qualification Phase prior to PPQ.  Results of test method validation are documented in the Process Test Method (TM) Qualification Report(s).  Process test methods are documented in manufacturing and quality procedures as part of the Device Master Records (DMR).

	•	Update Equipment Development File(s) (EDF) – In accordance with QAP 4.17, update and approve the Equipment Development File (EDF) for each qualified equipment or fixture.
	•	
	•	Determine Continuous Process Controls – Using the results of the PFMECA (approved in the Development Phase) and results of the Equipment/Process Qualifications, controls are put in place to recognize when the equipment used in the process begins to drift.  This allows for preventive maintenance of the equipment to be scheduled prior to any effect being observed on the product being produced.

	•	Finalize the PPQ Protocol – In order to validate that the process can repeatedly manufacture product that meets specification, the final Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) Protocol is created. The PPQ Protocol defines how validation will be conducted including test parameters, final product characteristics, manufacturing equipment, and decision points on what constitutes acceptable test results.  The PPQ protocol may also include requirements for Bioburden and LAL Bacterial Endotoxin testing if not handled in a separate protocol.

Reference Process Validation in Appendix A10 for additional information regarding process validation.
	•	Validate the Design Transfer

NOTE – PDP3 discusses design transfer from Process Development to Operations in two steps.  The first step was initiated in the Development Phase and is the transfer of the knowledge required to manufacture the device, which is called Design Transfer. This step is completed in the Qualification Phase.  The second step is the transfer of responsibility for all business-related aspects of manufacturing to Operations, which is called Manufacturing Transfer.  Manufacturing Transfer is completed in the Launch Phase and is discussed in more detail in the Manufacturing Transfer section (Appendix A13).  

Design transfer is the introduction of a design into the production environment.  Equipment/Process Qualification is performed in order to ensure that the design was correctly transferred into the Device Master Records (DMR).  

The purpose of this step is to ensure that –
	•	Control of all the deliverables required to manufacture the product has been transferred to Operations.
	•	Operations has reviewed the deliverables to ensure that they are correct and complete and contain all the information required to manufacture the product.

Transferring the Device Master Records (DMR) (including the BOM, final approved Design Drawings, accurate Item Masters and final approved Labels and Information for Use (IFU)) to manufacturing using alpha-revision released documentation is the major activity of design transfer. 

NOTE – It is NOT necessary for design transfer to occur all at once. It may occur in several steps over time.
Reference the section on Design Transfer in Appendix A9 for additional requirements for transferring the design from Process Development to Operations.

	•	Finalize Labels and Information for Use (IFU) – Final labels are ordered so that they can be used during the PPT and launch builds.  Final labels include labels on both external and internal packaging.
	•	Complete Information for Use (IFU) and Order IFUs– The English version of accompanying literature is translated into the multiple languages required for the product and put in the final format.  Final IFU conforms to standards for IFU layout and formatting.   Final IFUs are ordered so they can be used during PPT and launch builds.

	•	Perform PPQ
Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) is a major part of process validation.  The goal of PPQ is to establish that the process can consistently produce product that is within the defined specifications under well-defined process conditions.  The following key activities are part of process validation and PPQ execution –
	•	Perform the Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) Readiness Review – A PPQ Readiness Technical Review is performed prior to the start of the PPQ to verify that all documents, information, materials, resources, and equipment needed for PPQ are available.  The PPQ Readiness Review –
	•	Assesses test methods to ensure that they are suitable and validated.
	•	Reviews results of Software Validation, IQ, OQ, and PQ to ensure that all results are acceptable.
	•	Verifies that all operators that will take part in the PPQ have been trained and / or certified.
	•	Verifies that process validation protocols are complete and approved.
	•	Ensures that materials to be used in the PPQ builds are available and have been procured from approved suppliers per the Supplier Development Plan.
	•	Ensures that all issues identified in Process Characterization, Equipment Qualification, Pre-PPQ or PFMECA have been addressed.
	•	Verifies that all DMR documentation is ready for the builds.
	•	Verifies that EDF files are appropriately updated.
	•	Execute the PPQ Protocol – Once approval to start the PPQ has been granted by the readiness review, PPQ execution can begin.  All PPQ work is performed by trained and / or certified production operators, using top level and subassembly production work orders and using design-transferred documentation, including the same methods and procedures intended for ongoing production.  When the PPQ has completed execution, results are summarized in the Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) Report.
	•	Update the DMVM, PMVM, & RMW – Once testing is completed, the Design Master Verification/Validation Matrix (DMVM) and the Process Master Validation Matrix (PMVM) are updated to add traceability to test results.  Additionally, the Risk Management Workbook (RMW) (PHA, UFMECA, DFMECA, PFMECA) is updated with residual risks and to reflect any new knowledge obtained through the execution of the process validation activities.

Reference the section on Process Validation in Appendix A10 for additional details and consideration.

	•	Complete Supplier Development Report
In the Qualification Phase, the Supplier Development Report is completed and should include – 
	•	Provide the list of approved suppliers.
	•	Identify components, parts, or services where a second source supplier should be pursued.
	•	Reference assessment results for supplier manufacturing capabilities.
	•	Identify risks in sourcing or supplier quality.
	•	Reference or include a Dock to Stock component plan. 

Upon release of the Supplier Development Report all suppliers/components used in the manufacturing of the product will be Approved status (a requirement for First in Human use).

	•	Perform Physician Preference Test (PPT) Study
PPT, if required to validate marketing claims or fulfill regulatory requirements, is an element that may be included as part of Design Validation in phase 4. 
If PPT is conducted complete these steps and update the DHF checklist appropriately.
When included as part of the project activities, the Physician Preference Test (PPT) Study is typically the first human use of the product and is performed to confirm the results of design validation testing, confirming that the product satisfies the user needs and can be used as defined in the intended uses.

	•	Create PPT Protocol – The PPT Protocol is created to define –
	•	Physicians and sites that will participate in the study.
	•	A mechanism for obtaining customer feedback.
	•	Number of procedures to be performed as part of study.
	•	Success criteria for the PPT study.
	•	Intended uses that will be covered as part of the study.

Reference Physician Preference Testing section in Appendix A11 for additional details on the design of PPT studies.

	•	Execute the PPT Protocol – Execution of the PPT studies can only be performed after the following activities are completed –
	•	Regulatory approvals have been obtained.
	•	The Clinical Readiness Review has been performed and the product is ready for human use.
	•	The PPT Protocol is approved.
	•	Sites and physicians participating in the study have been identified and are ready to participate.

	•	Update Risk Management
Upon completion of any Phase 4 human-use activities, the Risk Management Report is updated.   In accordance with QAP 4.19, risk management activities must be completed and documented in the Risk Management Report (RMR) and must include a discussion of the acceptance of residual risks based on results of human use studies.

	•	Prepare for Manufacturing Transfer
Key activities performed in the Qualification Phase to prepare for the transfer of manufacturing responsibility to Operations are –

	•	Planning the transfer –The Manufacturing Transfer Plan (MTP) identifies the requirements that must be met to successfully transfer the knowledge and responsibility for manufacturing the product from Process Development to Operations.
	•	Plan the ramp up strategy – The Manufacturing Transfer Plan (MTP) specifies the number of units that are required to be built through the completion of the Launch Phase.  This includes –
	•	PPT Build
	•	Limited launch builds
	•	Full launch builds
	•	Qualify essential secondary suppliers – The Manufacturing Transfer Plan (MTP) may also discuss qualification of secondary suppliers to mitigate any risk with sole-sourced components or assemblies.
	•	Verify readiness to transfer – The Manufacturing Transfer Technical Review is performed to assess performance against the established metrics for transferring manufacturing responsibility to Operations, including –
	•	Target costs
	•	Target yields
	•	Capacity
	•	
	•	In preparation for product launch, the Advanced Sourcing group, with support from the Project Team, prepares to transfer purchasing and planning responsibilities to the Production buyer/planner.
	•	Order materials – Launch quantity plus 3-month supply of materials is ordered to support quantities per the Launch Plan.
	•	Transfer materials to inventory – For all materials ordered as memo-type purchase orders, engineering memo(s) are completed to transfer materials to production inventory.
	•	Finalize standard cost – Final component cost is established with the suppliers based on the forecast in the Launch Plan. 
	•	A summary of outstanding purchase orders (suppliers, cost, expected due dates, quantity on hand, etc.) is provided to the appropriate production buyer/planner.

Reference the section on Manufacturing Transfer in Appendix A13 for additional requirements for transferring responsibility to manufacturing.

	•	Train Field Personnel
Prior to launching the product, the sales force is trained to sell the product and physicians are trained on how to use the product safely.  In order to accomplish this –

	•	Based on the Launch Plan, training materials are created to support the Field / Physicians training.  
	•	The Field / Physician Training Materials are then used to train the sales force and physicians.  
	•	The Field / Physicians Training Records provide a record of all physicians and field personnel that have successfully completed training.

	•	Exit Qualification Phase
The Qualification Phase is exited once a Go/No-Go decision is made as a result of the Phase 4 Gate Review (see.
Table 8).

Launch Phase Description
	•	Transfer Responsibility for Manufacturing to Operations
Once the product has been launched, and Process Development has met the transfer requirements specified in the Manufacturing Transfer Plan (MTP), then the transfer of responsibility from Process Development to Operations can be completed. The following are the key transfer activities –

Execute the Manufacturing Transfer Plan –
Complete deliverables required per the plan.
Complete any secondary supplier qualification activities as outlined by the MTP or Secondary Supplier Qualification Plan.
Complete inspection reduction activities as outlined per the MTP or PMVM.
Continue to update the PFMECA and RMW as needed.
Complete Additional Accelerated & Real-Time Aging Study Report(s) per the Accelerated & Real-Time Aging Study Protocol.
Monitor SPC and process capabilities to ensure processes are stable and operating as designed

	•	Perform the Manufacturing Transfer Review – The Manufacturing Transfer Update Review is the point at which Operations accepts the transfer of responsibility from Process Development.  This review can cover – 
	•	Current state of manufacturing
	•	How each requirement specified in the Manufacturing Transfer Plan (MTP) for transferring responsibility to Operations was met
	•	Secondary supplier approvals or Post-Phase 5 plans as applicable
	•	Availability of raw materials 
	•	PFMECA recommendations 
	•	Process capability 

When acceptance occurs, Operations becomes responsible for continuous improvements of the manufacturing processes.  Operations can decline to accept the transfer until all requirements specified in the MTP have been met.  If Operations rejects the transfer, then Process Development must either continue to address the requirements specified in the MTP or seek to modify the MTP or Charter.  

Refer to the Manufacturing Transfer section in Appendix A13 for additional information on the manufacturing transfer step.
	•	Monitor Launch Performance Metrics
The Launch Plan identifies the launch performance metrics that will be monitored once the product is launched, as well as the time period during which the monitoring will be performed.  Launch performance metrics may be measured using – 
	•	Limited Market Release (LMR) – Restricted Distribution – Requires LMR protocol & report. 
	•	Controlled Inventory Release (CIR) – Full Release – Customer Service Limits Sales to Specific Accounts – No protocol and report are required.
	•	Product / Market Surveillance

NOTE – The monitoring time period ensures that the Launch Phase lasts for only the pre-determined amount of time specified in the Launch Plan.

Launch Performance Metrics – Launch performance metrics are selected to measure and confirm customer satisfaction.  Typical launch performance metrics can include –
Adverse events and Medical Device Reports (MDRs)
Complaints
Customer satisfaction surveys
Number of units sold

Market Surveillance – Conduct review of the competitive landscape, literature review, review of symposia, etc… discussing the product.
Monitoring Time Period – The monitoring time period is intended to provide a definitive end to the Launch Phase.  At the end of the monitoring period, if the launch performance metrics are below expectation, then corrective actions can be performed to address the identified issues.  

	•	Monitor Field Performance
Once the product has been launched, field performance is monitored through the use of –

Product/Market Surveillance, including –
Complaints
Adverse Event Reporting
	•	Corrective Action / Preventative Action (CAPA) Processes

Complaints are analyzed using the Complaint Evaluation Standard (CES), which provides a template for evaluating complaints.  The CES provides –
Procedure to follow when evaluating a complaint to gather maximum data
Complaint codes to use when logging complaints
Guidelines for recording identifying information for the product

	•	Continue the Regulatory Strategy
In the Launch Phase and beyond, Regulatory continues to execute the regulatory strategy established in the Regulatory Plan.  The Regulatory Plan is updated and the Summary Technical Document (STeD) is created and approved in the Launch Phase and includes –

Any changes to the regulatory strategy.
Regulatory approvals by country, including any restrictions.
Post approval commitments made to regulatory agencies.
Strategy and requirements, including resources for post-project closure submissions.

	•	Close Out the Project
Project Closeout involves the following activities –

Celebrate Success – The accomplishments of the team should be celebrated to –
Recognize achievement.
Foster teamwork.
Build relationships.
Identify Lessons Learned –   The Lessons Learned Review provides an opportunity to learn from the experiences of the project and improve performance on future projects.  In order for the Lessons Learned Review to be effective, the following should be considered –
Lessons can include opportunities for improvement as well as institutionalizing areas of success.
Force rank the opportunities for improvement.  
Consider using an independent facilitator to encourage open discussion and full team participation. 
Discuss possible ways to improve on each lesson learned.
For long projects, identify lessons learned at the end of a phase instead of the end of the project.
Provide the lessons learned review notes to the Project Management Office for sharing with future teams and addressing of systemic issues.
Archive Project Artifacts – Ensure that all project artifacts are archived and can be accessed for future reference.
Disband the Core Team – At the end of the Launch Phase, the Project Core Team can disband.

	•	Exit Launch Phase
The Launch Phase is exited and the project is complete once the following criteria are met –

	•	Transfer to manufacturing is complete.
	•	Time for monitoring of field performance satisfaction has elapsed and customer satisfaction is confirmed.
	•	The Project Close-Out Review is completed and approved.

	•	Continue the Product Lifecycle
Even after the Launch Phase is complete, the organization must continue the product lifecycle to ensure product success.

Manage the Product Lifecycle – These are all the activities that go into designing, manufacturing, selling, distributing, using, and disposing of a product.  The Lifecycle Management information in Appendix A12 includes several key considerations for phases of the lifecycle after commercialization of the product.  
Manage Design and Process Changes – After the Launch Phase, design and process changes may be required as a result of –
Continuous improvement
Obsolescence

PDP Tailoring
PDP3 is flexible and can be adjusted to meet the needs of different types of product development efforts by tailoring the deliverables and activities required in PDP3 for the specific needs of the project. Tailoring ensures that only essential activities are planned and executed in keeping with the “lean PDP” philosophy on which PDP3 was built.
Tailoring is an activity that the project core team must perform at the start of the project.  The processes for tailoring the PDP are discussed in the following sections –
Project Classification
PDP Tailoring
Special Tailoring Considerations

Project Classification
Within PDP3, product development projects are differentiated based on expected effort, cycle time and cost.  To assist the product development team with tailoring the PDP, each project will be classified based on various characteristics of the proposed product.  This classification should be completed and documented in the Project Charter.
Projects can be classified into one of four types based on complexity – 
Breakthrough – Projects that involve creating the first generation of an entirely new product and / or process.  They may include one or more of the following – 
	•	Existing therapies using a new medical technology.
	•	Technologies which are not a core competency of the company.
	•	Products for which there is no predicate device.
	•	New therapies.

Next Generation (Next Gen) – Projects that create new products based on a current technology or product.  They may include one or more of the following –
	•	Application of existing medical technology.
	•	Technologies which may or may not be a core competency of the company.
	•	Availability of predicate devices.
	•	Significant new features or improvements.

Derivative – Projects that refine or improve on existing product platforms to deliver value to the customer.  They can include one or more of the following –
	•	Application of existing medical technology.
	•	Technologies which are a core competency of the company.
	•	Availability of predicate devices.
	•	Expansions or evolution of existing designs (product and / or processes).  Classic “line extensions.”
	•	New functionality that is visible to the customer.

Design Change – Projects that refine or improve on an existing design or process, without providing any visible benefit to the customer.  They can include one or more of the following –
	•	Improvements in the form, fit, or function of a device.  
	•	Labeling changes.
	•	Reliability improvements.
	•	Manufacturing process improvements.

The following criteria will be used to assist in the classification of each project, based on the characteristics of the product being designed – 
Table 10 – Project Characteristics
Characteristic
Description
Financial Risk
High – A large investment is required to develop the product.
Medium – A moderate investment is required to develop the product.
Low – A small investment is required to develop the product.
Clinical Risk
High – Involves a new medical technology or therapy which is breaking new ground, typically requiring clinical trials.
Medium – Involves a medical technology or therapy for which a predicate device is available, but which is new to the company.
Low – Involves a medical technology or therapy which is familiar to the company.
Regulatory Risk
High – Requires a new PMA submission.
Medium – A change to an existing PMA or new 501(k) with some regulatory planning complexity.
Low – Requires relatively straightforward regulatory activities (e.g. letter to file or 510(k) with clear Covidien predicate devices).
Market Risk
High – The product will be used to enter a market in which the company is not currently competing and which may require extensive VOC work to understand the user needs.
Medium – The company understands the market, but new product features will require VOC activities to ensure customer satisfaction.
Low – The company has a good understanding of the market and the product line, and will only require limited VOC activity.
Technology Risk
High – Requires the use of technology or materials that are new to the company, or uses the technology or materials in a significant new application.
Medium – Does not require new technology or materials, but uses the technology or materials in a new application.
Low – Uses existing technologies and materials in a well understood application.
Technical Complexity
High – Requires the development of new processes and core competencies that the company does not currently have.
Medium – Does not require development of new processes or core competencies, but requires a high level of design work to be performed.
Low – Requires a relatively low level of design work.

Table 11 classifies projects based on rating against these criteria. Where the classification is unclear or ambiguous, the more conservative (higher risk) project classification should be considered.  For example, if a project has four “High” and two “Medium” level risks it should be considered a Breakthrough.  For most projects, it is typically clear from the beginning what project classification is most fitting.  This matrix helps clarify project classification when the team is unclear.  It is intentionally not fully prescriptive, to provide adaptability to the project manager and core team to choose the most fitting classification.

Tailoring Plan
The table below describes the steps to be followed in order to tailor the PDP based on the complexity of the project – 
Process Step
Detailed Instructions
	•	Determine Project Classification
Review Table 11 to determine the classification for the project.  Project classification is recommended by the core team and approved in the Charter -
Breakthrough
Next Generation
Derivative
Design Change
	•	
	•	Review Recommended Tailoring 
The Tailoring Plan tab of the PDP3 RACI includes tailoring guidelines for each class of project specified in Table 11.  The recommended guidelines provide the minimum set of deliverables recommended based on the classification of the project.
Some deliverables are “Mandatory” and must always be produced.
	•	
	•	Perform Project-Specific Tailoring
Determine the appropriate tailoring of phases, deliverables, and reviews by –
Adding or removing entire deliverables.
Changing scope of individual non-mandatory deliverables.
Adding, removing, or combining reviews.
Combining phases.
	•	It is especially important to add deliverables that are specific to the project but that don’t appear in the PDP3 RACI. For example, development builds and prototype iterations are critical to the project but are project-specific and therefore not listed in the PDP3 RACI.  Unless these deliverables are added, the project scope and schedule will be less than what is actually required.
	•	A rationale / explanation must be provided for all PDP “Recommended” deliverables that are tailored-out of the project. These rationales are subject to review and approval as part of the project plan review.
	•	All deliverables listed as “Mandatory” cannot be tailored out and must be kept in-scope.  
	•	Sometimes, a substantially equivalent work product already exists (e.g., from an earlier product version).  These can be leveraged with detailed rationale in the Project Plan or a separate Adoption Justification referenced in the DHF.  In these instances, the deliverables are not considered to be “tailored out” but rather replaced by the equivalent work product.
	•	
	•	Complete Tailoring Plan
A Tailoring Plan template, included in the PDP3 RACI, is populated to document all tailoring decisions proposed by the Core Team. This template includes all deliverables to be produced in each phase of the project as well as the rationale behind each “Recommended” deliverable tailored-out or reduced in scope.

	•	Review / Approve Recommended Tailoring
The Tailoring Plan is approved as part of the Project History File (PHF).


Tailoring Examples
The Tailoring Plan tab in the PDP3 RACI shows a list of deliverables and reviews that are mandatory for all project types and a set of additional recommended deliverables for each project type. This combined set provides a starting point for tailoring. 
For Breakthrough and Next Generation projects, less tailoring is expected since PDP3 was designed to accommodate these more complex projects. For Derivative and Design Change projects, more tailoring is expected to ensure only value-added activities are included.

Figure 5 – Example of Section of Completed Tailoring Plan

Combining Phases
As part of Tailoring, the team may choose to combine PDP Phases.  Rationale and justification must be approved as part of the Project Charter.  It must also be addressed in the Project Plan.   
Phase combination standards:
	•	Though Phases may be combined, all Mandatory deliverables must be completed.  (Whether created or adopted.)
	•	In almost all cases, Phase 2 and 3 are not combined.  If they are, special allowances to properly document Design Freeze must be addressed in the Project Plan.
	•	If Phase 4 and 5 are combined, Mandatory deliverables for Phase 5 must be addressed prior to product launch.
	•	Combined Phase Reviews must cover content from all of the reviews that are combined. 
Tailoring Phase and Design Reviews
PDP3 Phase and Technical Reviews can be combined to fit the needs of the project.  Combined reviews cover content from all combined reviews in one session.
Table 12 provides recommendation guidance on possible combination of reviews.  Phase Gate reviews are combined only when the phases themselves are combined.  A “Stand-alone” recommendation suggests not combining with any other review content.

Dealing with Previously Developed Products
When PDP3 will be applied to products not developed using PDP3, the tailoring guidelines can be used to identify gaps in the documentation between the process used to develop the product and PDP3, such that the gaps can be addressed and risks mitigated.
A gap analysis can be performed by reviewing all mandatory deliverables, as defined in the PDP3 RACI, and for each mandatory deliverable –
	•	Identifying if an equivalent document is available.
	•	Determining if the information required by the deliverable is contained within any other document.
	•	Determining if the deliverable is applicable for the type of project planned.  
	•	Using the Tailoring Plan Template, create a cross-reference between PDP3 deliverables and the deliverables for the previous product that satisfy the PDP3 deliverables.
	•	Address any remaining gaps.

Appendix A – Process Considerations
This section is designed to provide additional best practices and process guidance for critical elements of the PDP.  These practices are recommended and provide confidence that a quality product is delivered that meets both the customer and business need.
Since each product is unique, not all elements of the Process Considerations section will apply to all projects.  It is important for the Project Manager and team to discuss how to apply these best practices such that the final product meets both the customer and business needs.  
This Process Consideration section is for reference purposes only. Please refer to Covidien’s quality system documentation (e.g., QAP4.1) for mandatory design control requirements.

A1 – Gathering the Voice of the Customer
One of the most important activities performed during the Concept Phase is gathering the Voice of the Customer (VOC).  Collection of good data from our customers early on has been proven to be imperative to creating a commercially successful product.  Figure 6 depicts the key VOC activities – 
 
Figure 6 – VOC Activities

Creating the Voice of the Customer Plan – The VOCP details all activities that will be performed throughout the product development cycle that are used to gather the Voice of the Customer.  This includes all “touch points” where customer feedback on the product is being sought, as well as the anticipated number of iterations through the VOC cycle documented in Figure 6.
Creating the user needs – Translating the user needs from VOC to more specific user needs that define the features and characteristics of the product.  
Prioritizing the requirements – Determining which requirements are most important to the customer. This priority will be used by Engineering to negotiate the technical specifications with marketing if the need arises.  The Critical to Quality (CTQ) requirements are the critical few requirements, typically 3-5 total, that are the highest priority.
Reviewing the user needs – The review of the user needs ensures that the requirements represent the user needs and meet the characteristics of good requirements, especially that they are complete and can be validated.
Translating user needs into technical specifications – Translating the User Needs into the Technical Specifications re-specifies the requirements using “engineering language”.  The technical specifications add requirements that don’t originate with the customer (e.g. national or regulatory standards), and would include limits and tolerances where applicable. 
Translating technical specifications into engineering design specs – Adequate design documents must be produced to support the development of Concept prototypes. While neither complete nor formally reviewed, these specs should adhere to good engineering practices.
Validating User Needs with the customers – Validation of the requirements with the customer is performed to ensure that the Voice of the Customer is accurately captured.  
	•	Validation of user needs is not the same as product validation, which will occur after the product is built and in the Qualification Phase.  
	•	One typical and effective way of validating requirements with the customer is through the use of various prototypes to display important product characteristics.
Several iterations of the activities above may be performed throughout the Concept Phase to develop preliminary User Needs and Technical Specifications adequate to begin the Feasibility Phase.

A2 – Lean Product Development 
Elements of the Lean Product Development methodology have been integrated into the PDP3 as specified in Table 13.  
NOTE – Reference Lean Terminology in Appendix A3 for a definition of terms in the “Going Leaner” column.

Table 13 – Lean Principles in PDP3

PDP 2.0 Lean Activities
Going Leaner
Define What Adds Value to the Customer
VOC activities are the starting point for defining what adds value to the customer.
User Needs flow down to the manufacturing processes that are required to build the product, and can help in determining where the non-value added activities in the process are.
Identify Muda (see definition below in A3), and remove if non-essential.
Explore Alternative Solutions
During the Concept Phase, many alternatives are explored and the design begins to converge into an optimum solution.
Create trade-off curves and decision matrices to help evaluate the multiple alternatives.
Eliminate Waste
PDP3 provides for tailoring the process so that only value added activities are included.
Create Value Stream Maps (VSM) of the present and future state to identify wastes.
The Nine Wastes of Product Development section in Appendix A13 identifies the types of wastes typically observed in a product development process.
Project teams are encouraged to seek out and eliminate these wastes in their implementation of PDP3.  
Two methods of eliminating waste (see definitions below in A3) are –
Use of an Obeya
Poka Yoke
Continue to Learn and Improve
The Concept Selection Report details the knowledge gained about the competition.
PDP3 includes a Lessons Learned Technical Review to reflect on the performance of the project.
Use of A3 problem-solving methods.
Encourage team to question everything by asking why, why, why, why and why to drill down to the real cause of problems.
Reduce Variation by Standardizing Processes, Parts, and People
PDP3 includes many activities that are designed to reduce variation in the design and in the process.
PDP3 incorporates the re-use of components as a method of evaluating the competing concepts during the Concept Phase.
Reduce variation in the design by re-use of components between products.
Reduce variation in the process by re-using processes that are capable and in control.
Reduce variation in engineering skills by providing training.
Integrate Suppliers Into the Product Development Process
Supplier Development activities occur throughout the product development process.
Value suppliers for their technical expertise.
Balance material cost and quality.



A3 – Lean Terminology
There are various terms that are used in Lean Product Development, including –
Muda: Non value-added – Any activity that adds time or cost to the product at no benefit to the customer.  
Obeya: Big room – In Lean Product Development, each project has its own space where stakeholders can go to be visually updated of project progress.  The Obeya provides visual updates by –
	•	Displaying charts and graphs depicting program timing, milestones, and progress to date.
	•	Displaying work products that are indicative of the progress of the project.  
	•	Providing a place for the Project Team to hold daily 5-minute meetings to discuss current issues and activities.
Poka Yoke: Error proofing – Error proofing (prevention) helps eliminate waste from the process by reducing inspection time.  Error proofing can include –
	•	Design of fixturing/process to prevent non-conforming product and prevent errors from being made and passed on to the next process.
	•	Design of automatic feedback and control processes to prevent non-conforming product from being made or passed on to the next process.
	•	Use of checklists.
	•	Re-using components across products.
	•	Re-using processes that are capable and in control.
A3 Analysis: Single Sheet of Paper – A3 is a standardized way of communicating by creating a report using one side of a piece of paper (A3 refers to the paper size). There are three types of A3 reports –
	•	Status – An A3 status report tells the story of an ongoing activity and answers the questions –
	•	What is the objective of the activity?
	•	How well are we doing meeting the objective?
	•	How much was accomplished versus what was planned?
	•	What issues need to be addressed?
	•	What do we plan to do next?
	•	Informational – An A3 informational report is used to tell a story with the intent of sharing information.  
	•	Problem Solving – An A3 problem solving report is used to tell the story of an approach to solving a specific problem.  It should contain the information using a Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology.  The main elements of an A3 problem solving report are –
	•	Description of the problem.
	•	Root cause analysis of the problem, using the “5 Whys” to ensure drill-down to the root cause.
	•	Short term and long term corrections to the problem.
	•	Plan for implementation of the corrections (what, where, who, when).
	•	Follow up actions to verify that the corrections were successful.
Where possible, A3 reports should use visual aids to tell the story instead of words.  Every word included in the A3 report should be necessary to help tell the story.
Value Stream Maps (VSM)
 The Value Stream Maps (VSM) are useful because –
Waste and sources of waste can be visually identified.
Instead of fixing just one issue, the picture of the entire future state is revealed, addressing many issues.
An initial value stream map captures the present state (what we are doing today) and a second VSM captures the future state (where we would like to be). Activities are then chosen to incrementally achieve that future state at some point in the future. The path to the future state becomes an iterative process of continuous improvement.
Nine Wastes of Product Development
There are nine wastes that a Lean Product Development process such as PDP 2.0 attempts to eliminate.  The nine wastes are –
	•	Scatter - organizational changes or events that disrupt teamwork, the flow of information and knowledge, and the cadence or rhythm of a development project (e.g., reorganization, changes in work schedule, etc.).
	•	Barriers to Communication – Intellectual class structures and departmentally focused thinking (e.g., language, distance, information systems, etc.).
	•	Wrong Tools – Focusing more on the tool instead of the best way to acquire the knowledge and learning needed.  Some examples are –
	•	Prototyping versus simulating.
	•	Simulating versus testing.
	•	Re-inventing versus re-using.
	•	Handoff – Separation of knowledge, responsibility and feedback.
	•	Useless Information – Time spent by product development staff on preparing information, progress reports, studies, analyses and presentations that add no value to the final design of the product.
	•	Waiting – Conventional product development activities are organized sequentially, which can force decisions and learning to stack-up and happen at once.  For example –
	•	Waiting for signatures.
	•	Waiting for technical information.
	•	Wishful Thinking – Setting specifications early before enough data is available to support the concept or design.
	•	Testing to Specifications – Testing conformance to specifications with the limited goal of passing the test. Testing should also be performed for other reasons, e.g. discovering how to make the product fail beyond the conditions of use, how to make it better or cheaper, etc.
	•	Discarded Knowledge – Most knowledge generated during a development project is unintentionally thrown away because development teams are disbanded, documentation is incomplete or inaccessible, etc.

A4 – Design Convergence of Different Concepts
The Concept Phase evaluates various concepts and selects the concept that is the best strategic fit for the customer and the business.  In other words, in this phase, product designers must obtain a good understanding of the problem domain (user needs) and start exploring the boundaries of the solution domain (alternative designs).  The goals of the phase are met when it is proven that one or more solutions exist to solve the problem.
The Concept Phase starts with a set of user needs and develops several ideas on how to best address those needs. These ideas go through a series of quick iterations using concurrent engineering to evaluate the alternatives from several viewpoints (R&D, Manufacturing, Marketing, Quality, etc.).  
When a concept is shown to have a low probability of success, continued iterations are halted on that concept.  Areas that show promise can be “converged” with other concepts until design convergence is achieved and one idea is selected to continue to Feasibility, or until no reasonable alternative exists.  The number of iterations can vary for each concept and for different projects.
Typical Iteration
Figure 7 depicts a typical flow for the design convergence iterations. After the Evaluate Prototype step, a decision is made whether to –
	•	Continue to improve the concept.
	•	Develop another concept.
	•	Stop iterating, with or without a suitable concept.


Figure 7 – Typical Iterations in Concept Innovation Phase

Evaluating the Concepts
In order to properly and efficiently evaluate the various concepts, the following tasks are performed – 
Identify the CTQs and other key metrics to help evaluate the concepts.  Key criteria that define success in these areas are identified in Table 14 below.
Iteratively refine the concept design and compare it against the CTQs (i.e. user needs) and key metrics (i.e. business needs).
Eliminate concepts that indicate a high probability of not meeting customer or business needs and continue to refine concepts that have favorable metrics.
Converge and combine successful design elements and re-evaluate against the CTQs and key metrics until one or more concepts are selected.
Determine what technical hurdles are encountered and where risks remain.  These risks are documented and mitigated through the use of the Technology Risk Assessment (TRA) within the Project Plan.

A5 – Characteristics of Good Requirements
Definition – A requirement is a property that a product must have to provide value to a stakeholder. [IEEE]  
Good requirements are an essential part of any product development process, and they set the foundation on which subsequent product development activities are built.  The foundation must be strong if the product and project are to succeed.
Requirements documents use different words to distinguish requirements, goals, and other statements –
	•	Shall – Indicates a requirement.
	•	Should – Indicates a goal.
	•	Can, Will or May – Indicates a fact or purpose.
Requirements are stated in an active voice using the word “shall”.  For example:
The catheter shall weigh less than .25 lbs.
Table 15 defines the characteristics of good requirements.
Table 15 – Characteristics of Good Requirements
Characteristic
Description
Uniquely Identified
	•	Each requirement shall have a unique identifier that does not change.

Unambiguous
Each requirement should have only one interpretation.
Each major characteristic of the final product shall be described using a single unique term.  If a term can have multiple meanings, then it shall be defined in a glossary. 
The following ambiguous words should be avoided when writing requirements –
	•	Usually
	•	Slow / Fast
	•	Frequently
	•	Approximately
	•	Effective
	•	Good
	•	Easy
	•	Always / Never
	•	Normal
	•	Average
	•	Adequate
	•	Possible
	•	Instantaneous 
	•	Infrequent
	•	Higher / Lower
	•	Better
Correct
Each requirement shall be compared with predecessor documents and standards to ensure that it is in agreement and technically feasible. 
Verifiable
Each requirement specified shall be testable.   A testable requirement is one for which measurable acceptance criteria can be provided to verify the requirement through test, inspection, analysis, or review.
Complete
	•	Each requirement specified shall express a whole idea or statement. 
Consistent
The requirements specification does not have requirements that contradict any other requirement in the document.  Consistent terminology is used throughout the document. 
Modifiable
Each requirement in the requirements specification shall be expressed separately, not intermixed with other requirements.  The same requirement shall not appear in the requirements specification in more than one place. 
Traceable
The requirement shall be backwards traceable to higher-level requirements, forward traceable to lower level requirements, design, implementation and verification. 
Prioritized
Each customer requirement shall be ranked for importance based on the value to the customer. Typically, three priority levels are used –
	•	High – The requirement must be implemented in the finished product.
	•	Medium – The requirement should be implemented in the finished product, and reasonable effort should be invested to include it.
	•	Low – The finished product will be successful without this requirement, but the value of the product would be enhanced by including it.


A6 – Developing a Robust Design
Definition – A robust product is one that works as intended regardless of variations that are encountered in the manufacturing process, variations resulting from deterioration over time, or variations in use related to people or environment.  
In order to achieve a robust design, a Design for Excellence (DFX) methodology is used.   Design for Excellence contributes to a robust design by encouraging the use of concurrent engineering principles throughout the development of the product. Use of DFX results in improved customer satisfaction because of –
	•	Improved product quality
	•	Improved reliability
	•	Reduced product cost
DFX is also interpreted as a collection of “Design for” methodologies.  In PDP3 the “X” stands for:
	•	Manufacturability and Assembly
	•	Reliability
	•	Safety
	•	Six Sigma
These methodologies are summarized in the sections that follow.
Design for Manufacturability and Assembly
Design for Excellence (DFX) techniques are used in the Feasibility Phase to simplify the design of the product and make it easier to assemble and manufacture.  
A DFX technical review is performed in the Feasibility Phase to –
Review the current state of manufacturing capabilities.
Identify critical suppliers.
Identify opportunities to use existing suppliers.
Identify opportunities to reduce the number of parts.
Identify opportunities for design simplification.
Identify tolerances that might not be within the capabilities of the manufacturing processes.
Review tolerance stack up of any components that may be reliant on tolerances or capability of assembly equipment
Identify assembly difficulties and address assembly improvements through the design of the components.
Estimation of Costs of Goods Sold (COGS) and assembly costs.

Proposed changes to improve the manufacturability of the product based are documented in the DFX Technical Review.
Design for Reliability
Design for Reliability (DFR) techniques are used in the Feasibility Phase to identify sources of variation that can impact the design and to eliminate or reduce the impact of sources such as:
Source of Variation
Description
Tolerances
Variation allowed by the device design due to the tolerances and tolerance stack-up.
Piece to piece variation
Variation due to the manufacturing process.
Deterioration over time
Wear and tear as the part is used over its expected life.
Use duty cycle
Variations due to continuous or intermittent use.
Operating environment
Variations due to the user and / or environment.
Interactions / Interfaces
Variations due to other entities that interact or interface with the device.  These entities can be materials, components, people, or other products and systems.

Figure 8 contains a graphic representation of how PDP3 deliverables are used together with DFR techniques to ensure robustness in the design.

Figure 8 – Robust Design DFR Techniques




As shown in Figure 8, the principle Feasibility Phase activities that contribute to a robust design are described below –
[1] Technology Risk Assessment (TRA) – The TRA is documented within the Project Plan and is an analysis of the potential technical threats to achieving the project objectives.  Although the purpose of this document is to help manage project risk, some of the technical risks identified can be assessed and mitigated by performing robust design activities.  Areas of risk include:
	•	Failure to meet standards
	•	Failure to meet performance requirements
	•	Intellectual property
	•	Product complexity
	•	Use of new technologies
	•	Use of new materials
	•	Manufacturability issues
	•	Knowledge gaps

[2] Specification Conformance Matrix – User Needs and the Technical Specifications define the intended uses of the device and specify what functionality the device must exhibit.
[3] Design Characterization Matrix – This matrix defines the activities and testing needed to develop the Design Drawings, as well as the design challenge testing needed to ensure that those specifications are correct.  Design challenge is defined below.
[4] Design Drawings – The Design Drawings document the design that implements the customer and product requirements.
[5] and [10] Manufacturing Process Specification – The [5] Manufacturing Procedures/Quality Procedures document the processes that are used to produce the design.  Once the sources of variation and failure are understood, the [10] Manufacturing Procedures/Quality Procedures are updated with methods of control.
[6] Design Challenge Testing – Design Challenge Testing is performed to understand the sources of variation for the product.  Design Challenge Testing can include testing of –
	•	Component dimensions
	•	Component material
	•	Subassembly dimensions
	•	Top assembly dimensions
	•	Functional requirements of device design
	•	Extreme environments for use 
	•	Development of extreme test models to challenge the device at and beyond its intended design limits and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in order to amplify failure rates.
Design Challenge Testing is performed as per the Design Challenge Testing Protocol(s) and test results are summarized in the Design Challenge Testing Report(s).
[7] Tolerance Analysis – Tolerances specified on drawings can impact both the design and the manufacturing processes.  Tolerance Analysis also contributes to identifying sources of variation.

Figure 9 – Tolerance Impact

Tolerance Analysis is performed by determining the worst case tolerances and summing the component tolerances linearly. Each component dimension is assumed to be at its maximum or minimum limit, resulting in the worst possible assembly or performance limits.
Tolerance Analysis is performed on dimensional tolerances of all interfaces where two components interface including –
	•	Components
	•	Subassemblies
	•	Top assemblies
	•	Packaging
	•	Accessories
Monte Carlo simulations can also be used to perform tolerance analysis.  Monte Carlo analysis is useful in cases where more than three tolerances are stacking or in complex non-linear cases.  Monte Carlo simulation can also be used to estimate mechanical reliability in complex mechanical systems or to optimize complex scenarios to determine the optimum tolerances for reliability or cost.  This technique is described in the Robust Design Techniques section.  The results of the tolerance analyses are documented in the Tolerance Analysis Report.
[8] Risk Management Workbook (RMW) – RMW includes the Procedure Hazard Analysis (PHA), the User Failure Mode Effects & Criticality Analysis (UFMECA) and the Design Failure Mode Effects & Criticality Analysis (DFMECA).  The RMW identifies potential hazards of use and potential failure modes for the product, assesses the risk associated with those hazards or failure modes, prioritizes issues for corrective action, and implements corrective actions to address the most serious concerns. 
[9] PFMECA – PFMECA is used to determine how the process can contribute to product failures.  The PFMECA is a section within the Risk Management Workbook (RMW)
[11] Design V&V – Design Verification & Validation is performed to verify that controls established to minimize variability and mitigate failures are adequately performing their intended purpose.
[12] Process Validation – Process validation is performed to establish process controls.
[13] Marketing Support Material and Testing – Documents the Reliability testing performed to verify Marketing claims. 
[14] Launch Plan – The Launch Plan defines the Marketing Support Testing that needs to be performed.  

Design for Safety 
A design cannot be robust without first ensuring safety.  Risk Management activities are integrated throughout the phases of PDP3, but these activities are of particular importance in the Feasibility Phase where the design can still be influenced to ensure an effective and safe design.  
Figure 10 shows how risk control measures are integrated into the PDP process steps that ensure hazards are assessed and controlled.  Knowledge obtained from the safe design elements are fed back into the design.  This process iterates until the design is found to have an acceptable level of risk.
 The safe design elements included in PDP are intended to provide –
An inherently safe product.
Protective measures for known and foreseeable hazards that have not been eliminated through design work.
Information to further mitigate remaining hazards.


Figure 10 – Safe Design Elements

Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)
Six Sigma is a methodology for problem solving and continuous improvement.  DFSS is used to improve products and processes by identifying and understanding the potential sources of variation and then making the design and the process less susceptible to these sources of variations as long as the costs incurred do not exceed the perceived benefit. 
In order to identify and control variation, DFSS uses the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) problem solving method to affect improvement.  DMAIC means –
	•	Define – Describe the problem in a problem statement.
	•	Measure – Determine the current performance or capability of the process.  Design of Experiments (DOE) are a very useful tool to measure current performance and establish causes of variation.
	•	Analyze – Perform statistical analysis of the data to understand the cause and effect relationships in the design or the process.
	•	Improve – Implement and verify improvements based on the analysis of the data.  DOE can also be used to determine that the causes of variation have been reduced.  
	•	Control – Plan to ensure improvements are sustained.
There are various tools that can be used to incorporate DMAIC.  Table 16 defines tools that can be used for improving the product and the process.

Robust Design Techniques 
There are many techniques which can be used to ensure that the design is a robust design.  Two well established techniques that are recommended are –
Monte Carlo Simulation – Monte Carlo simulation is used to perform tolerance analysis.  Monte Carlo simulation takes the individual distribution of the tolerances of each individual component involved in a tolerance stack-up.  The simulator randomly selects values within these distributions and incorporates them into a mathematical model representing the tolerance stack up situation.  The mathematical model is generated by the engineer based on the specifics of the tolerance situation.  The output is only as good as the information input and model generated by the engineer.  The simulator then generates an output distribution.  The results of the simulation include the population mean and standard deviation and normality, the 3-sigma limits for the worst case tolerances. This analysis provides the percentage of components estimated to be in and out of the specification range (estimated design or process capability).
Design of Experiments (DOE) – DOE is used to identify important variables, to estimate their effect on a certain product characteristics, and to optimize the settings of these variables to improve the design robustness.  The key steps in designing an experiment are – 
	•	Identify the objective of the experiment. Typically these include finding true causes of problems, finding how causes interact, finding the best solution to a problem, or testing a solution to ensure it has no undesirable side-effects.
	•	Define what is to be measured to show the results of the experiment.
	•	Identify the factors that are to be controlled during the experiment. Consider all things that may affect the measured result, then select those that are to be varied and those that are to be held constant or otherwise monitored.
	•	For each factor selected, identify the set of levels that the experiment must consider.
	•	Select the actual trials to take place.
	•	Perform the trials as planned.
	•	Analyze the results.
	•	Take appropriate actions based on the results.

A7 – Developing a Robust Process
A robust process is one that can produce product that consistently meets specifications within target cost and yields.  In order to achieve a robust process, the potential sources of variation must be understood and controlled.  
Figure 11 displays the sources of variations that can affect a process, and therefore impact the performance of the product.

Figure 11 – Process Variation

The sources of variation that affect a process include –
Variation due to materials.
Variation due to equipment (gauges).
Variations due to the environment.
Variations due to operator.
Variations due to the methods used.

PDP3 has activities designed to determine –
How the different sources of variation can influence the output of the process.
How interaction of the various inputs can affect the output of the process.
How to monitor and control the impact of variation.
How the process is performing against established criteria.

Statistical analysis is extensively used to identify and control process variables.  

Process Characterization & Optimization
Several methods are used to characterize and optimize the process as it evolves in the Development Phase –
Design of Experiments (DOE) is used to –
	•	Determine the interaction between variables. Determine which variables are critical and not critical for control of the process.
	•	Define the optimum input settings and the operating window for the process to produce components and/or assemblies within specifications.
	•	Test a solution to ensure that there are no undesirable effects.
	•	Determine the causes of variation.
Process flow diagrams are created to –
	•	Define and analyze processes.
	•	Build a step-by-step picture of the process for analysis, discussion, or communication. 
	•	Define, standardize or find areas for improvement in a process.
Fishbone diagrams are used to determine key sources that contribute most significantly to the problem being examined. DOEs can then be used to verify and quantify the contribution and determine possible corrections.
Process Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) is performed to ensure that potential failure modes and their associated manufacturing or assembly process causes have been considered and reduced as much as is technically and economically feasible.  The PFMECA also – 
	•	Facilitates prioritizing preventive and corrective actions.
	•	Identifies variables that can be subjected to process controls.

Process Capability
Once process characterization has been completed and the process has been optimized, the process capability of each process is determined.  A process capability index relates the engineering specification to the observed process behavior.   
When calculating a process capability index it should be noted that a sufficiently large sample size must be used, and an assumption of a normal distribution is made.
, 
Where:  Min = minimum; USL = Upper Specification Limit;
LSL = Lower Specification Limit; μ = Mean; σ = Standard Deviation

Typically Cpk values of 1.33 or higher are considered acceptable and indicate a stable process.

Control Charts are used to determine if the process is in a state of statistical control and whether the process has the capability required to produce product within specification.  Control Charts –
Provide visibility when special causes of variation are present.
Reflect the extent of common causes of variation that must be reduced.

Gauge Repeatability & Reproducibility
Before a manufacturing process can be controlled or optimized, the uncertainty of the measurements being made as part of that process must be understood.  A Gauge Repeatability & Reproducibility (R&R) study is performed to determine the precision of measurements using instruments and gauges.  The precision of the measurement has two components –
Repeatability – The precision of the measurement under similar conditions, i.e., the difference in the average of the measurements made by the same operator using the same gauge measuring the same part multiple times.
Reproducibility – Precision under different conditions, i.e., the difference in the average of the measurements made by different operators using the same gauge and measuring the same part.


Figure 12 – Repeatability vs. Reproducibility

A typical procedure for conducting a Gauge R&R study includes the following steps –
	•	Obtain samples that represent the actual or expected range of process variation.  Typically, samples from three different lots are used, and the total number of samples should be more than five.  Each part needs to be identified for the study.
	•	Identify the number of operators to be used in the study.
	•	Setup the equipment as required by manufacturing procedures, including calibration.
	•	Each operator measures all parts in random order.
	•	Repeat the cycle for the number of trials required.
	•	Analyze the data to determine –
	•	If the measurement system has sufficient resolution to detect part-to-part variation.
	•	If the process is in control.
	•	If the measurement process can be applied consistently by each operator.
	•	How much of the total variation can be attributed to the gauge, operator, and parts.
A8 – Verifying and Validating the Product Design
As Figure 13 graphically depicts, Design Validation ensures that the product actually does what the customer (or user) wants the product to do in the intended use environment (or a close simulation).  Design Verification ensures that the product meets its design requirements.

Figure 13 – Design Verification and Design Validation

Verifying the Product Design
Definition – Design verification means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled.  (FDA)
Verification activities are undertaken to provide objective evidence that design outputs conform to design inputs.  The objectives of design verification include –
	•	Finding defects.
	•	Assessing conformance to specifications.
	•	Proving conformance to regulations.
	•	Verifying safety mitigations are effective.
In order to accomplish these objectives, several key elements of design verification should be incorporated –
	•	Verification activities that can be used to provide objective evidence that design outputs conform to design inputs.
	•	Verification tests that can be used to show conformance to specifications and standards. 
	•	Methods for ensuring that design verification tests are designed to find defects, and not just to show that the requirements are met.
	•	Ensuring the validity of the verification tests through –
	•	Appropriate selection of sample sizes.
	•	Test methods used that can provide valid results.
The following sections discuss these key elements in more detail.
Verification Activities
As described above, verification activities are performed to gather objective evidence that design outputs conform to design inputs.   Verification activities include –
	•	Inspection – Visually noting and recording a specific attribute of the product to confirm compliance with requirements. Inspection is used to verify properties best determined by examination and observation (e.g., color).
	•	Test – Verifying the performance of a product by measuring its characteristics or attributes, e.g. their extent, size, capacity, amount, or quantity.  The following are typical measurements for hardware devices –
	•	Demonstration – Providing a known set of input conditions and verifying that the device behaves as expected.  
	•	Analysis – Analysis can include –
	•	Design review of drawings. 
	•	Review of Historical data and / or documentation to be able to determine that the product provides the specified characteristic or feature.  
	•	Simulation of extreme operating conditions when it is not realistic, feasible, or cost effective to establish those conditions for physical testing.
	•	Certification – Written assurance that the product conforms to a standard.  Certification is typically performed by a third party with subject matter expertise.
Every test specified for verification shall produce some form of objective evidence as described in the process steps above.
Verification Tests
Table 17 lists tests that are typically included as part of design verification along with key considerations that make the test effective and efficient.

	•	Required by China FDA
	•	GB/7 14233.1 – Test methods for infusion, transfusion, injection equipment for medical use – Part 1: Chemical analysis methods
Sterility
	•	The purpose of sterilization is to inactivate the microbiological contaminants on a device and transform the non-sterile items into sterile ones.
	•	The sterilization process is validated to show how effective it is at reducing the level of bioburden below that which is specified.
	•	Testing must also verify that there are no negative impacts on the product or packaging as a result of sterilization.
	•	Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) must be selected (typically 10-6).
	•	Test for effects of re-sterilization on product and packaging.

	•	A test that shows that required reliability can be attained by establishing a reliability prediction based on verification data obtained.
	•	Tolerance stack-up.
	•	Reliability demonstration tests.
	•	Accelerated life test.

Worst Case Analysis
	•	A test that emphasizes the most unfavorable operating conditions for the device.
	•	Consider opposites –
	•	Lowest / highest
	•	Minimum / maximum
	•	Don’t limit the analysis to just two variables.
Packaging / Shipping / Storage Tests
	•	A test that emphasizes extremes of transportation and storage conditions.
	•	Shock and vibration testing to simulate transport by rail, road, sea and air.
	•	High and low environmental temperatures.

	•	Shock.
	•	Vibration.
	•	Thermal cycling.
Robustness Testing
NOTE – Discrepancies and errors in device function and performance are much more costly to correct later in the development cycle.  Typically, the cost to find defects increases exponentially as the development cycle progresses.  

Therefore, verification related activities should be started early in the Development Phase to identify discrepancies as soon as possible.

Various methodologies can be applied in creating verification tests to ensure that the product design is both robust and efficient.  Some of these methods include –
	•	Design of Experiment (DOE) – In the Development Phase, DOE is used to identify sources of variability and their effects on certain product characteristics or to reduce the sources of variability.  In the Development Phase, DOEs can be used to demonstrate that the sources of variability do not affect a specific product characteristic.  For example, through the use of DOE, it can be demonstrated that no interaction between the sources of variability will impact the ability of the friction characteristic meeting specification.
	•	Testing at the Specification Limits – In order to ensure that the product performs as specified in the user environment, testing should be performed at all specification limits.  As Figure 14 graphically represents, there are various performance limits specified for the product –
	•	Specification limits – Specification limits are established based on actual performance taking into consideration manufacturing process variation.  
	•	Design limits – The Technical Specifications specify design limits which the product must meet.  These are the limits used for testing during verification.
	•	Destruct limits – Destruct limits are arrived at during design characterization if test-to-failure activities are performed.

Figure 14 – Specification Limits
One or more verification tests must be performed to ensure proper operation at the specification limits.  Possible methods of verifying proper operation at the specification limits are –
	•	Build product at the specification limits and verify proper performance of the product.
	•	Build product outside the specification limit, in the destruct limit region, and test for proper performance of the product.
	•	Perform statistical analysis of the product tested and make population estimates based on mean and standard deviation.
	•	Perform analysis using historical data, design reviews of drawings, or other type of review to arrive at an engineering judgment that the product will perform properly at the specification limits.

Ensuring Validity of Test Results
To ensure that design verification (and design validation) testing provides valid data, several key considerations must be taken into account when designing the tests –
Sample Sizes 
Sample sizes used for design verification testing must be statistically significant.  Many factors weigh into the decision of how many samples to require –
	•	Type of test (e.g., quantitative variables or qualitative attributes).
	•	The sample population.
	•	The number of samples available for testing.
	•	The risk factors (e.g., confidence intervals).
Test Method Validation
Test Method Validation is conducted to confirm that the methods used for verification testing are fit for the intended use and can provide valid data.  Test methods are validated to quantify each attribute below –
	•	Accuracy – Difference between the true value and the accepted reference value.
	•	Precision – Closeness of repeated readings on each other.
	•	Linearity – Change in bias over the normal operating range.
	•	Gauge R&R – The combined estimate of measurement repeatability and reproducibility.  Reference the section in Appendix A7 on Gauge Repeatability & Reproducibility for further information on Gauge R&R.
	•	Range – The measurement range for which the test method is validated.
	•	Uncertainty – An estimated range of values surrounding the measured value in which the true value is believed to be contained.  The following can contribute to measurement uncertainty –
	•	Bias – The difference between the observed average of measurements and its true value.
	•	Calibration – A measurement process that assigns values to the property of an artifact or to the response of an instrument relative to reference standards.  The purpose of calibration is to eliminate or reduce bias in the user's measurement system relative to the reference base.
	•	Environmental Condition – The effect of ambient temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors on the ability of the test method to measure accurately.
 
Validating the Product Design
Definition – Design validation means establishing by objective evidence that device (product) specifications conform to user needs and intended use(s). (FDA)
Validation is the aggregation of all efforts employed to assure that the design will conform to user needs and intended use given projected variations in –
	•	Components.
	•	Materials.
	•	Manufacturing Process.
	•	Use Environment.
Validation tests are designed to address the needs of all users and all intended uses.  Validation testing can include –
	•	Historical comparisons to older devices, e.g. a 510(k) historical database search.
	•	Scientific literature review.
	•	Simulated use testing (bench testing).
	•	Clinical testing (clinical studies, if performed).
	•	Usability studies.
	•	Animal studies.
	•	User preference testing.

Validation Tests
Table 18 defines key considerations for each of the validation tests defined above.
Table 18 – Validation Tests
Validation Test
Key Considerations
Historical Comparisons to Similar Devices
	•	Review of documentation available to show comparisons with similar devices that can be used as objective evidence of a working solution to an issue.
Scientific Literature Review
	•	A review of publications, such as trade journals, that report original empirical and theoretical work in the natural and social sciences, and within a specific scientific field to highlight evidence that provides objective evidence of a working solution to an issue.
Usability Studies
(Human Factors Study)
	•	Usability studies are a method of testing how the user interacts with the product and evaluates –
	•	Performance – how the user accomplishes the intended use of the product.
	•	Accuracy – what types of mistakes the user makes and how they are made.
	•	Ease of Use – how easy is it for the user to learn to use the product without labeling aids.
	•	Satisfaction – how satisfied the user is with the product.
	•	Usability studies can be performed in a simulated use environment.
Animal Studies
	•	Animal studies are a method of simulating the actual use environment as closely as possible without using human subjects.  Animal studies can be used to –
	•	Verify efficacy related requirements.
	•	Human factors evaluation.
	•	Usability studies.
Clinical Testing
	•	Clinical testing is performed, if required by the Clinical Development Plan, to validate the use of the product in the actual use environment and using human patients.  
	•	Validation in a simulated use environment may be performed if appropriate regulatory clearances are obtained prior to testing.
Simulated Use Testing
	•	Simulated use testing is performed on the bench using models that simulate actual patients (e.g. medical phantoms).  
	•	This type of testing is used to verify user acceptance of the product, work flows, and ease of use.
User Preference Testing
	•	User preference studies are performed prior to completion of the design and are used to evaluate how users react to particular features of the product.

A9– Design Transfer
The purpose of design transfer is to ensure that the device design is correctly translated into manufacturing production specifications.  Design transfer includes –
Transferring of the Device Master Records (DMR) to manufacturing.
Approval by Operations of all documents that make up the production specifications after assessing to ensure completeness and adequacy through process validation.
Validating all software used in the manufacturing process or for maintaining quality records for the device.
Design transfer is usually not an activity that is performed entirely at one time, but rather it is performed at intervals throughout the Development and Qualification Phases.  
Effective design transfer requires that –
	•	Design documentation needed to manufacture the device is complete and correct.
	•	Suppliers are approved and performing as expected.
	•	Manufacturing processes are well understood. 

[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

A10 –Process Validation
Definition – Process validation is establishing documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance that a specific process will consistently produce a product meeting its pre-determined specifications and quality characteristics. (FDA)
In order to ensure that a process meets this definition, the following activities are included as part of process validation –
	•	Process Validation Planning.
	•	Equipment Qualification.
	•	Process Characterization and Optimization.
	•	Operational Qualification.
	•	Performance Qualification.
	•	Process Monitoring and Control.
Figure 16 shows how these process validation activities are inter-related and 
Table 19 describes each process validation activity.

Table 19 – Process Validation Activities
Activity
Description
	•	Validation Planning
The Process Master Validation Matrix (PMVM) is used to manage the validation activities for the processes that will be subjected to validation. The PMVM includes –
	•	A list of all processes to be validated.
	•	A list of equipment qualifications to be performed.
	•	Traceability to validation protocol for each process.
	•	Traceability to validation report for each process.
	•	Requirements for revalidation of processes.

The PMVM is created in the Feasibility Phase and is updated as required in subsequent phases.

	•	Equipment/Process Qualification
Equipment/Process Qualification is performed to ensure that the equipment, as installed, is capable of operating within established limits and tolerances, as well as throughout expected operating ranges as established by the Equipment Requirement Specification for that piece of equipment.  

Equipment/Process Qualification includes Installation Qualification (IQ), which has been previously defined in the Qualification Phase.
	•	Process Characterization and Optimization
Process characterization and optimization includes activities to –
	•	Identify sources of variability – Identify the expected variability of the processes and allow the specification limits to be set.  The specification limits are used to establish acceptance criteria for the Operational Qualification and Process Performance Qualification.
	•	Identify which outputs to measure – Define the relationship between process parameters and measured outputs, including which parameters most directly influence outputs. This information is used to determine what outputs to monitor during the process performance qualification.  
	•	Identify which parameters to track – Identify key parameters which are allowed to vary in the manufacturing process. These parameters can be used to challenge the process during the process performance qualification.

Reference the Developing a Robust Process section in Appendix A7 for further information on these activities.

	•	Operational Qualification
Characteristics of Operational Qualification (OQ) include –

Show that at the limits of the proposed process window in terms of maximum operator variation, maximum raw material variation, and at the process parameter limits, the process is capable of manufacturing components or assemblies that meet the product specifications.  
Typically executed at the high limits and low limits of the process.  By high and low limits, the different process parameters are set to the levels that create the (greatest) amount of variation in the product. For example, setting the parameters on a stretching machine to ensure the shortest and longest output material.
To ensure a truly robust process if the operational qualification passes statistical tolerance limits or has a capability of 1.33 or greater indicates that the processes is highly stable and unlikely to produce non-conforming material or assemblies.

	•	Performance Qualification
Performance Qualification (PQ) is divided into –

	•	Process Performance Qualification (PQ) – The purpose of process performance qualification is to demonstrate that the process is reproducible and effective by testing the process to determine whether it is capable of consistently producing a product which meets its specification targeted at specific attributes that must be tested independently of the PPQ due to testing complexity issues.    
	•	IQ/OQ should be successfully completed prior to the start of PQ.
	•	Full assemblies, subassemblies or abbreviated assemblies (aka “shorties”) are produced independently of the full PPQ to test the specific product attribute(s).
	•	Challenges must be repeated with enough samples to ensure results are statistically valid.

	•	Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) – The purpose of the product performance qualification is to demonstrate that the process has not adversely affected the product and that the product can meet its specifications.  The Product Performance Qualification will vary substantially, depending on intended use and on the technology incorporated into the device.  Production volume and batch sizes can impact the statistical techniques used.

	•	A minimum of 3 lots is used to establish consistency and process capability across multiple lots of product.  Each lot must be large enough to pass statistical requirements independent of the other lots of product manufactured as part of the PPQ.

NOTE – Product Performance Qualification (PPQ) can be combined with Design Validation.  

	•	Process Monitoring and Control
Once a process has been shown to be capable and in a state of statistical control through process validation, it must be monitored and controlled to ensure that it remains in a state of statistical control.  The monitoring step provides the catalyst for improving the process, as indicated by Figure 15.


Figure 15 – Process Improvement Cycle

	•	Monitoring the Process – As a result of the Process Validation, Upper and Lower Control Limits for each process are established.  The performance of the process against these control limits should be monitored on a periodic basis to find out of control conditions.  Once an out of control condition has been encountered, work to find and correct any assignable causes can be performed to bring the process back under control.
	•	If only common causes of variation are present, the output of a process has a distribution that is stable and predictable over time.
	•	If assignable causes of variation are present, the process output is not stable over time.

	•	Finding and Correcting Assignable Causes – When an out-of-control condition has been identified, the operation of the process should be studied to determine the cause.  The cause should then be corrected and prevented from occurring again, as much as possible.  Assignable cause variation can include –
	•	Operator variability.
	•	Defective materials.
	•	Machine malfunction.
	•	Operator error.

	•	Improve the Process – Improve the process by reducing the common cause variation.  Common cause variation can include –
	•	Inappropriate procedures.
	•	Poor design.
	•	Poor maintenance of machines.
	•	Environmental contaminants.
	•	Variability of materials.
	•	Human factors.
	•	Variations in electrical supply.
	•	Vibration.
	•	Ambient temperature and humidity.
	•	Normal wear and tear.
	•	Variability in settings.
	•	Poor training.

	•	Analyze the Revised Process – When actions have been taken to eliminate an assignable cause, the effect of those actions should be apparent on the control chart.

A11 – Physician Preference Testing (PPT)
Physician Preference Tests (PPT) constitute the first time the device is used on humans, unless a Clinical Study is performed. PPT, if required to validate marketing claims or fulfill regulatory requirements, is an element that may be conducted as an extended element of Design Validation in phase 4. PPT is not performed to verify safety or efficacy and is not considered part of a clinical study. 
PPT is performed to confirm the results of design validation in an actual use scenario.  A PPT Study can evaluate how the customer interacts with the product and can confirm the attributes quantified during design validation and listed below.   If desired, performance of CTQ requirements could be confirmed through a PPT Study, i.e. 
	•	Performance – How the customer accomplishes the intended use of the product.
	•	Accuracy – What types of mistakes the customer makes.
	•	Ease of Use – How easy is it for the customer to learn to use the product without labeling aids.
	•	Satisfaction – How satisfied the customer is with the product.
The following are key elements to consider when designing the PPT study –
	•	Sample size – Statistically valid sample sizes should be used for testing.
	•	Physician demographics – Select physician demographics based on the population of physicians that are likely to use the device, and the demographics that are most likely to affect the outcome of the therapy and customer satisfaction with the product.
	•	Level of experience
	•	Familiarity with the therapeutic procedure
	•	Information for Use (IFU) – Where possible, incorporate IFU into the study to evaluate the customer’s understanding of the Indications for Use, Contraindications, Intended Uses, Warning and Cautions.
	•	Intended Uses – Incorporate all intended uses of the product into the study, or perform a study per intended use.
	•	Support – Availability of Covidien employees at the case is often key to ensure proper execution and data collection
	•	Acceptance Criteria – Acceptance Criteria specified in the  PPT Protocol should be based on –
	•	The device performing as intended, based on the feedback from physicians participating in the study.
	•	Physician preference scores for some or all CTQ features.

A12 – Lifecycle Management
Figure 17 displays a typical product lifecycle, and boxes shaded in gray are covered in detail in the various sections of PDP3. However, all elements of the lifecycle must be considered when developing the product design and labeling.   


Figure 17 – Product Lifecycle


Key considerations for lifecycle phases not discussed previously include –
Distribution 
	•	Ensure distribution only to trained field personnel and trained physicians.
	•	Ensure that products can be located anywhere in the distribution channel in the event of a recall.
Customer
	•	The time period for retaining records of the design and manufacture of the product must meet regulatory and legal requirements and be consistent with the expected life of the product.
	•	The method for communicating to physicians and patients any potential health issues associated with the product must be available.


Disposal 
	•	Labeling must include any special disposal precautions required by standard or by law.
	•	Environmental hazards associated with the disposal of the product must be taken into consideration in the labeling.
	•	Hazards to patients, users, bystanders, or animals related to the disposal of the product must be accounted for in hazard analysis.
	•	Review of applicable standards that govern the disposal of the product must be an input into requirements documents.


A13 – Manufacturing Transfer
During development of the manufacturing processes, several activities help ensure that the resulting processes are capable of producing a product that -
Meets cost targets.
Meets yield targets.
Can be produced in the quantities required.
These activities include –
	•	Employing the methodologies discussed in the Developing a Robust Process section in Appendix A7.
Early collaboration between R&D, Process Development, and Operations in assessing the design for manufacturability. If the design is not manufacturable, then it can increase scrap and rework once it gets to production.
Specific areas that should be assessed prior to the transfer of responsibility to Operations, as defined in the Manufacturing Transfer Plan, include the items listed below –
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Cost to manufacture
Manufacturing cycle time
Scrap costs
Rework costs
Yields
Process capability
PFMECA recommendations
Operator training
Supplier performance
Availability of materials

The Manufacturing Transfer Review compares metrics gathered during the Qualification and Launch Phases to ensure that the requirements set forth in the MTP have been met. There are two cases -
	•	All Requirements Met – If the metrics are favorable during the Manufacturing Transfer Review, then Operations accepts the transfer of responsibility for manufacturing the product.  
	•	Some Requirements Not Met – Conversely, if some of the requirements in the MTP have not been met, then Operations may reject the transfer of responsibility until those requirements are met.  Figure 18 graphically displays possible causes for not meeting MTP requirements.


In this case, Process Development will employ the methodologies specified in the Developing a Robust Process section (Appendix A7) until all requirements specified in the MTP have been met.  Additional methodologies that can be used as an aid to improve the manufacturing transfer metrics are –
	•	DMAIC Techniques – This Six Sigma methodology allows the team to Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control changes to improve the process.  Reference section Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) (Appendix A6) for more information of the DMAIC process.
	•	Lean Manufacturing Techniques– Eliminating waste by using Lean Manufacturing.  Reference the section on Eliminating Waste with Lean Manufacturing in this appendix.
Both DMAIC and Lean techniques can be used to address common problems as discussed below.

Figure 18 – Manufacturing Transfer Metrics

As Figure 18 indicates, cost reduction, improved yields, and improved throughput can be achieved by –

Reducing Costs
Reducing scrap and rework costs – 
	•	Apply Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma principles to reduce non-value added activities and eliminate waste from the manufacturing process and reduce scrap costs.
	•	Apply the Six Sigma DMAIC process to help identify the root causes of rework (typically process, equipment or operator) and improve on the causes to reduce rework.
Reducing COGS – 
	•	Eliminate waste, as defined in the Eliminating Waste with Lean Manufacturing. 
	•	Simplify the design by reducing the number of parts or processes required to manufacture the product.
	•	Improve the relationship with suppliers to reduce purchase costs.

Improving Yields
Improving Process Capability –
	•	Optimize the process limits.  Limits that are too tight can create false failures, and limits that are too loose can create failures downstream.
	•	Improve or replace equipment and fixturing to increase process capability.
	•	Monitor the output of the process using Statistical Process Control (SPC) to give an indication of problems before they occur.  This will allow detection, correction, and prevention of process variation that cause defects.
Error Proofing the Process – Error Proofing is a technique for implementing fail-safe mechanisms to prevent a process from producing defects. Use PFMECA to identify possible errors that can be generated by the process and implement approaches to –
	•	Prevent an error from happening in the first place.
	•	Provide a warning before the error occurs.
	•	Stop the operation so the error cannot occur.
	•	Provide a method for auto-correcting the error.

Increasing Throughput
Improving Yields – Refer to the Improving Yields section above.
Reducing Time to Manufacture  – Time to manufacture can be reduced by –
	•	Operator training.
	•	Simplification of assembly of the product.
	•	Implementation of Lean Manufacturing to eliminate the waste of delay and waiting.
Increasing Capacity – Capacity is the maximum amount of product that a manufacturing line can produce per unit of time.  To increase capacity –
	•	Ensure that there are no bottlenecks in the production process.
	•	Ensure batch size is optimized for best capacity.
	•	Add additional equipment or a second production line, if needed.
	•	Reduce cycle time.

Eliminating Waste with Lean Manufacturing 
The seven types of waste that Lean Manufacturing attempts to eliminate are –
	•	Overproduction – Creating more product than is needed.  Overproduction is often used to make up for poor yields.
	•	Waiting – Waste of an operator’s time when they are waiting for a part or materials to perform a task or make a decision.  
	•	Conveyance (Transportation) – Movement of products, materials, or information.  Manufacturing floor layouts can cause excess transportation.
	•	Motion – Unnecessary movement of an operator (walking, lifting, reaching, or stretching).
	•	Inventory – Finished products, parts, and supplies kept in inventory add cost, and they can become scrap if they exceed shelf life.  
	•	Over-processing – Occurs when a step in the process does not add value to the customer.
	•	Correction (Defects) – Includes inspections to detect defective product and the paperwork caused by quality issues related to scrap and rework.  
See also section Lean Product Development in Appendix A2 for more information on Lean methodologies.

Appendix B – Changes Before and After Launch 
Figure 19 displays the process for making changes throughout the product lifecycle.  This process before product launch is different than the process after product launch.

Figure 19 – Design Change Process

Design Changes Prior to Product Launch 
At each phase gate review, the project team’s request to continue into the next phase will be denied if the objectives of the current phase have not been met.  
Additionally, if information is learned that would require activities in the previous phase to be performed, the phase of the project can be “demoted” to accurately indicate the project’s progress. Once demoted, the project proceeds forward according to the PDP guidelines for that phase, including completion of technical and phase gate reviews. Examples of this include –
During Feasibility, a concept previously thought feasible is proven infeasible and additional Concept activities need to be performed.
A failure during design verification or design validation can require a design change that moves the project back into the Feasibility Phase.

Design Changes After Product Launch
Once the product has been distributed for customer use, design changes may be requested via –
Product Surveillance – Monitoring of the product’s performance in the field will provide design change requests related to –
	•	Improved safety.
	•	Improved reliability.
	•	New intended uses.
Corrective Actions and Preventative Actions (CAPA) – The CAPA system will provide design change requests related to –
	•	Reliability issues.
	•	Manufacturability issues.
Voice of the Customer (VOC) – The VOC will provide change requests suggested by the customer, including –
	•	New features.
	•	New intended uses.
	•	Customer dissatisfaction.

Following product launch, the implementation of design changes will require that a new project be initiated.  The tailoring guidelines provided in the PDP Tailoring section should be followed to determine how PDP3 should be applied for the new project.  
Table 20 identifies the sources of potential change requests and the project types that may result.

Appendix C – Configuration Management and Document Revision Levels
Definition – Configuration Management (CM) – A discipline applying technical and administrative direction and surveillance to: identify and document the functional and physical characteristics of a configuration item, control changes to those characteristics, and record and report change processing and implementation status, and verify compliance with specified requirements. (IEEE)
Configuration management provides a method for –
	•	Uniquely identifying a work product.
	•	Managing changes to the work product.
	•	Protecting the configuration of a work product.

A development document is configuration managed with increasing rigor as it progresses through development. More specifically –
	•	Draft Work Products – Preliminary or draft versions of documents are managed with less rigor.  The following requirements apply to these documents.
	•	Assigned unique document identifier.
	•	Assigned a version number to track modifications to the draft document.
	•	Signed by at least the author (see PDP3 RACI).
Approval Prior to Design Freeze – Prior to Design Freeze, approved documents are managed with increased rigor. The following requirements apply to these documents.
	•	Assigned unique document identifier (i.e. the same identifier as assigned to the draft).
	•	Assigned a version number to track modifications to the draft document.
	•	Signed by author.
	•	Approved by the team per the PDP3 RACI.
After Design Freeze – After Design Freeze, documents are managed with a high level of rigor.  The following requirements apply to these documents.

PDP3 uses three levels of document revision control for configuration management.  Table 20 below describes the differences:

Table 21 – Document Revision Levels

“X” Level Release
Numeric Release
Alpha Release
Example Revision Numbers Format:
DWGS50467 Rev. X1, DWGS50467 Rev. X2, 
DWGS50467 Rev. 1, DWGS50467 Rev. 2
DWGS50467 Rev. A, DWGS50467 Rev. B
Also referred to as:
“Draft”
“Controlled Draft”
“Released”
Point of control:
Controlled by Team --  typically through Share Point and attached to lab books and protocol/reports when needed for design control traceability or IP support
Controlled Document in Document Control
Controlled Document in Document Control
Completeness:
In general, will be incomplete (though must be complete enough for design control traceability) 
Can be incomplete (though must be complete enough for design control traceability)
Typically complete unless QAP/template specifies completeness in “staged releases” (eg., DFMECAs)
Revision tracking:
No formal change tracking required
Formal change tracking required for DMR documents.  For most document types, tracking history from numeric revisions is removed when moving to alpha.
Formal change tracking required.

Appendix E – Device Master Records
The Device Master Records (DMR) contains all the information necessary to repeatedly produce devices that are within specification.  The deliverables which are part of the DMR do not all have to physically reside in the same location; instead the DMR Index can point to where the information can be found.  The DMR can point to the Design History File (DHF) for information related to the device.  Table 22 provides all required content for the DMR, a possible index for the DMR, and where the information would typically reside.
